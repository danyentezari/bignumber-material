00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.900
the idea of regression

1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.900
ghost back to what?

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.900
You know Sir Francis Galton.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.300
talked about in his

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.800
in his literature

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.100
There's a court where he says each.

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.300
Particularly peculiari is man is

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.500
 shared by Kinsman, but on average tallest degree now, there

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.700
 are different ways to interpret this.

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.600
quote from him and there is

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.800
 this phenomena that he's trying to talk about that

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.600
 has to do not just with people but

12
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.100
different things in nature, for example

13
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.400
When we say regression we talk about this thing called this concept

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.400
 of regressing back to the mean.

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.700
for example, if you look at people human

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.100
 beings

17
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.100
when a when when

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.200
 two people that their offspring tend to

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.900
 be taller than them on average two people when they

20
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.100
 have when they have children they tend to be taller than

21
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.400
 their parents.

22
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.300
and this happens

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.400
You know.

24
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.900
Over time The Descendants their children

25
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.200
 have kids they're tall already. They don't have kids

26
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.300
 they become taller still.

27
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.800
But eventually they will start to regress back to

28
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.300
 average height. So if you take people who are really tall

29
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.100
 exceptionally tall.

30
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.100
Their children can go up to seven feet seven foot

31
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.800
 five seven foot six, you know like yell me.

32
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800
Who was the NBA player?

33
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.300
But it doesn't continue like this forever. Like it's it's

34
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.100
 not as if people started to go like there are some

35
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.200
 exceptional cases where people were eight feet eight feet tall, maybe even

36
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.000
 a little more than that.

37
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600
But they won't go up to 20 feet tall eventually at

38
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.800
 some point.

39
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.100
They will start to like you you will find people who are who

40
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.500
 are very tall very very tall, but the

41
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.600
 children are shorter than them shorter than them.

42
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.700
and it and

43
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.200
gradually their offspring to start to become

44
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.800
 short of still.

45
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.300
So you see shorter people have taller kids but taller kids start to

46
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.100
 have shorty kids and they if you

47
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.200
 if you look at all of these.

48
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.900
Experiments these experiments where we have birth and these children

49
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.400
 grow up to become adults. They started cluster.

50
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200
towards the mean

51
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.900
average the average height of people

52
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.200
This is not just true with like the heights of

53
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.600
 people. It's true with.

54
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.700
many things how self-populate how

55
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.900
 diseases spread

56
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.200
so many examples like in the financial Market.

57
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.200
but the idea is

58
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.900
there is this.

59
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.000
truth

60
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.500
in this world where we live in where things start to

61
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.100
go to extremes, but eventually they'll come

62
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.100
 back.

63
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.100
to averages

64
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.100
Okay.

65
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.300
here

66
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.200
Francis golden has talked about people who are exceptional. They make

67
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.400
 too much. They're too rich or let's say they're too

68
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.200
 fast or they're too intelligent, but there are times

69
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.800
 where even they will start to see a decline.
