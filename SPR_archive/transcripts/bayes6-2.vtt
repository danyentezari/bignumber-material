00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.700
Alright, let's look at the second approach. And again,

1
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.500
 this is the approach to book takes to solve

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 this particular problem.

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.900
And here we are first going to calculate the posterior

4
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.700
 likelihood.

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.400
And then we will find.

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.300
the posterior probability

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.500
in the first approach we found the we found

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.100
 the positive probability. That was our attention from the

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.400
 start.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.900
Here, however, we're going to first calculate the posterior likelihood.

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.300
If you remember.

12
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.100
We said that odds and likelihood are

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.200
 both ratios.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.600
Where we are comparing one event.

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.400
against another

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.400
so likelihood is not a probabilistic number. It

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.900
 is not a number between 0 and 1.

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.600
or as probability is

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.700
So first, we will find this likelihood.

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100
Which can either be a very small or big number?

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.000
greater than one or below 1

22
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.700
and then we'll see how we can turn it to probability. So we're

23
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 going to go likelihood and then probability.

24
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.300
And then there's something you also need to know about the relationship.

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.400
between probability and likelihood

26
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.100
the posterior probability

27
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.000
Is proportional to the odds ratio and the

28
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.800
 likelihood ratio? Let me say this again.

29
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.900
posterior likelihood

30
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.200
which is not a

31
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.700
Probabilistic number it is not a number between 0 and 1.

32
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.500
Is equal to the odds ratio times the likelihood

33
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 ratio. So again, you're not going to get a probability from

34
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.800
 this expression.

35
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.200
You will see what the odds ratio are likelihood ratios are in a

36
00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 second.

37
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.200
However, the posterior probability.

38
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.800
which

39
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.500
is a number between zero one is proportional this

40
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.100
 symbol.

41
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.300
Is called the proportional symbol it's proportional to

42
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.600
 the product of the odds ratio and the likelihood ratio meaning if

43
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 this grows.

44
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.600
This will grow with it proportionally.

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.500
If this shrinks this will shrink with

46
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.100
 it proportionally.

47
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.900
Okay, it's a good idea to know this because you might come across

48
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.100
 these terms or this.

49
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.800
form of expressing their Bayesian theorem

50
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.600
in

51
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.300
other places

52
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.000
so let's first find out what the likelihood is and to do

53
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.800
 this we must first.

54
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.600
Find the ratio for the odds and then the ratio

55
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.100
 for the likelihood.

56
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.100
Now art is a ratio. So it's kind of

57
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.100
 redundant to say odds ratio, but I'm just doing this for extra emphasis.

58
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.600
So the odds

59
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.400
ratio

60
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.800
Is well?

61
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400
the probability of one event versus another

62
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.300
Here we want to know. What is the probability of being guilty?

63
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.600
Over the probability of being innocent a guilty hypothesis

64
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.200
 over an innocent hypothesis.

65
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.300
Now if you look up that table we had from before.

66
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.600
You will see where these numbers are coming from.

67
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.600
20 out of the 1,000 athletes tested positively 980 tested

68
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.900
 negatively.

69
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.300
Irrespective of whether they are actually guilty or

70
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.300
 not.

71
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.000
and it comes down to this and if

72
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.100
 we evaluate this we can

73
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.100
we get 1 over 49.

74
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.900
So this is the odds ratio.

75
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.300
the likelihood ratio

76
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.100
will be this.

77
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.800
The probability of testing positively given the athlete

78
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.300
 is guilty over the pause the probability of

79
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.200
 testing positively given the athletes innocent.

80
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.300
to find out what this part what these two

81
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.100
 probably these are

82
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.700
we will do it like so

83
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.800
since this is conditional probability. We

84
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.200
 know that we can express it like so we can express it like

85
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.500
 so

86
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.300
And since we already evaluated the joint

87
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.700
 and marginal probabilities, we can just plug in these values.

88
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.000
And you will get 95%

89
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.500
and this is consistent.

90
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.400
With what? We already know about the exercise.

91
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.200
Now probably of testing positively is 95%

92
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.000
whether you're actually I mean whether you're guilty or not.

93
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.400
The screening test will have a 95%

94
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.300
Accuracy, so the probability of it being accurate is

95
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.100
 95% So this

96
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.800
You know.

97
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.500
It's consistent what what we were given about the

98
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.000
 exercise.

99
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.900
similarly

100
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.400
the probability of testing positively when the athletes innocent

101
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.500
is 5%

102
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.400
and again this adds up.

103
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.200
but now if we were to put these two probabilities

104
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.200
Into a ratio which we now call the

105
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.000
 likelihood ratio.

106
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.700
So we'll be 0.95 or a point zero five 95% over

107
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.900
 5% We will get 19.

108
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.500
Now just for convenience for the

109
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.500
 next step. I ever expressed 19

110
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.900
 as 19 over 1. This is just 19 because

111
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.400
 once we multiply odds

112
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.600
and likelihood I want

113
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.100
 the notation to be

114
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.800
You know nice and tidy.

115
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.800
Otherwise, there's no reason for me to put one in the denominator.

116
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.700
This isn't actually change the value.

117
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.100
Now if you look at if we interprets in

118
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.300
 a different way.

119
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.000
It tells us that one out of every 19 athletes one

120
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.700
 out of every 19.

121
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.800
athletes

122
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.200
Who are accused of doping?

123
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.500
Are actually innocent.

124
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.300
One out of 19 athletes who are accused of being

125
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.800
 guilty.

126
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.600
Are actually unison.

127
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.700
So, what does that tell us about this?

128
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.500
test

129
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.200
so even though even though the odds are in favor of the athlete

130
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.900
 being innocent

131
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.700
the likelihood says that one out of 19 athletes.

132
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.000
Who are accused of doping are going to be innocent?

133
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.000
so

134
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.500
to answer the question.

135
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.500
That was first pose by this exercise. Let's actually take

136
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.000
 the product.

137
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.800
Of the Arts and the likelihood that's the posterior.

138
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.500
So again the posterior likelihood that's the likelihood

139
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.800
 still.

140
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.700
Is the product of the likelihood and the odds just for

141
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.400
 emphasis? Let me put here the word likelihood.

142
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.100
Okay, so the posterior likelihood is a product of likelihood and

143
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.700
 ratio.

144
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.000
and if you multiply these two fractions

145
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.100
We'll get 19 over 49.

146
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.200
Now this is still not 28%

147
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.400
and that's because this is not a probability.

148
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.500
To turn this into a probability.

149
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.000
What we have to do is this now by the way 49.

150
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.300
49 let me pull up that figure.

151
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.700
49 is the number of athletes.

152
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.300
Who tested positively but they are not doping.

153
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.100
In order for us to turn this probability in order

154
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.400
 for us to turn this likelihood into a probability.

155
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:29.700
we must

156
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.600
Also take into account the number of athletes who

157
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.500
 are doping who tested positively

158
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.000
 and they are doing so we have to add up these two

159
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.100
 numbers in the denominator and that's what we're doing over here.

160
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.100
So we have the number of athletes.

161
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.000
Who tested positively and they are doping over?

162
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.100
The number of athletes who tested positively and they are

163
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.400
 doping and the number of athletes who tested positively and they

164
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.300
 are not doping.

165
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.300
That gives us 19 over 68 and once

166
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:06.900
 again we arrive.

167
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.500
at 28%

168
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.000
now you may have a preference for one or the other.

169
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.200
One of the approaches we looked at.

170
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.200
But again, you are going to

171
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.600
 come across different ways of using the Bayesian

172
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:26.900
 theorem.

173
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.700
So the Bayesian theorem is not limited to a fixed algebraic expression.

174
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.500
It's this concept.

175
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.100
That we can associate.

176
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.100
prior information

177
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.400
a likelihood information

178
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.500
to arrive at to arrive at a new assumption
