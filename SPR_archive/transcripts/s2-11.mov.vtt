00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.500
okay, so now let's go back to

1
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.200
Moments, we're talking about moments on the one.

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.100
And we said that we will revisit.

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.500
the idea of the moment

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.200
the moment generating function

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.100
You know here on day two.

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.100
So let's go back over to the reader.

7
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.500
And let's bring up the example.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.200
from the

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.700
Moment.

10
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.200
when you hear of words like standard deviation

11
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.600
mean

12
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.400
kurtosis and skewness

13
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.600
these are kinds of

14
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.200
Moments, these are moments.

15
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.900
and moments describe

16
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.900
certain characteristics about the probability distribution

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.300
if I take you

18
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.900
If I take you back to the slide from day one.

19
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.300
So here we have this slide from day one.

20
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.300
And these are what the moments are. There

21
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.000
 are four kinds of moments. You have

22
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.600
 the mean.

23
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
Also known as the expected value for a random

24
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.600
 variable.

25
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300
Then you have the standard deviation.

26
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.700
Which you arrive at using the variance?

27
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.700
You have the skewness.

28
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.700
And then of course the fourth moment is the ketosis.

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.400
so the way you work your way towards

30
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.300
the second moment as you calculate

31
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 the first moment the week get to the third movement is a calculate

32
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.200
 the second moment fourth moment. You need the third

33
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.900
 moment. So each moment would need a proceeding moment.

34
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.100
for its measurement

35
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.900
so

36
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.400
Let's now look at.

37
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.400
the

38
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.200
moment generating function

39
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.000
for all four moments

40
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.000
Let's go to the reader to.

41
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.000
Make a note of this.

42
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.200
So moment.

43
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.900
generating

44
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.200
function

45
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.700
Okay, the moment generating function.

46
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.200
is a type of

47
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.500
generating function

48
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.400
What does that mean?

49
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.500
a generating function in general in

50
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.400
 mathematics is a way of

51
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.800
capturing the idea

52
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.900
of an ink of an infinite sequence

53
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.700
 of numbers

54
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.200
if you go back to the reader.

55
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.200
This may become clearer.

56
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.300
calculating the population mean

57
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.400
Has the same formula as calculating the expected

58
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.800
 value?

59
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.900
and that formula that sequence

60
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.400
is

61
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.700
what the moment generating function?

62
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.200
Talks about it is what the moment generally function.

63
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.900
expresses

64
00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.800
that

65
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.400
this function is go is

66
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.300
This function is this sequence the

67
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.000
 sequence of numbers?

68
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.700
and that sequence

69
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.800
Is further expressed by this expression?
