00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.400
If you recall.

1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.400
We said that.

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.400
the random variable

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.200
by definition is a function.

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.400
the random variable by definition the function

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.400
I will give you shortly the mathematical definition and then

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.800
 I will clarify it's a mathematical function that Maps.

7
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.200
the sample space

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.300
to

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.500
other probability space

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.700
what do I mean?

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.900
so

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.200
big X is what is used to

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.400
 represent?

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.500
Any random variable?

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.200
And sometimes they use uppercase letters like

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 uppercase y uppercase Z, but it's always going to be an

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.600
 uppercase letter when you see the uppercase letter in statistics. You

18
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.200
 know that you're looking at a random variable.

19
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.300
contained within the random variable are

20
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.100
individual

21
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600
experiments

22
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.200
an experiment is like flipping a

23
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.400
 coin.

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.400
or tossing a dice

25
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.500
or opening a box

26
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.400
of chocolates

27
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.600
If you often five boxes, those individual

28
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.400
 boxes are called experiments. If you flip a coin

29
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.300
 five times, you've done five experiments and so on.

30
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.100
So this small X's?

31
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.300
Oops, the small the small X's.

32
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.000
correspond to individual experiments

33
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.600
So you flip the coin once here you flip the coin another time

34
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.200
 here and so on and so on.

35
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.300
This is what we call the sample space.

36
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.300
Right a sample space is the thing

37
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.800
 that contains all of your experiments.

38
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.300
So the random variable will map the sample space.

39
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100
to the probability space

40
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.400
And what you're looking at in the second?

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.000
Row is the probability corresponding to this particular

42
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.000
 experiment. So this experiment has

43
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.600
 a as a

44
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.300
 probability of five. Okay, think about if you

45
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.500
 want to use percentage you can say this is a has

46
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.200
 a 5% probability. This one has a 10%

47
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.500
 probably 35% probably and so on.

48
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.400
And of course if you remember when you add them all up they add

49
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.800
 up to 1.

50
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.300
Right because a probability the word probability

51
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.500
 refers to a number a number that is between 0

52
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.200
 and 1 it doesn't go beyond one and it doesn't go

53
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.000
 under zero. It's not it's never Less Than Zero.

54
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.500
So that's what the random variable is. Again. It's a

55
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.600
 function. It's called a variable but

56
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.700
mathematically speaking. It's a function that Maps the sample

57
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.100
 space.

58
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.700
these sample space

59
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.000
right to a probability space
