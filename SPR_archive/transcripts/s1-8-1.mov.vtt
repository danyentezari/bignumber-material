00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.300
The random variable will give you the number of outcomes in

1
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.400
 an experiment the probability distribution.

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.700
also known as pmf will give you the probability of

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.200
an outcome within an experiment.

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.900
so, we now starting to see the full picture with the

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.400
Most important component in all of statistics and

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.600
 probability Theory let's move on to this example.

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.500
And automobile parts manufacturer is sipping six lots of

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.800
 components to their vendors.

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.600
6 containers

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.400
containing Auto Parts to their vendors

11
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.200
some components in the lots are defective. However, the number of

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.500
 defects found that each lot is as follows. So box

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 number one or Lot number one has zero defects.

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.000
Box number two has two and so on. This is the table for

15
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.100
 the probability distribution.

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.200
Any of these Lots can be selected randomly and shipped

17
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.800
 to a vendor.

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.700
Let X be the random variable.

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.100
For the number of defects found in each slot. So it will

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.800
 be the table or the column containing the number

21
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.300
 of defects found in each box.

22
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.400
Similar to The Shear inflection example we looked at.

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700
And the possible values of X are 0 1 and 2.

24
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.600
make sense

25
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.700
because you can either have zero defects.

26
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600
one defect or two defects

27
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.900
they have like the company that counted defects

28
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.100
 did not find anything more than two defects. So zero

29
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.400
 one or two.

30
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.800
in these six events

31
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.000
six events correspond to the lots of containers

32
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.100
three have the result. Well, you know,

33
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 it's it's explaining this three halves the result or X is equal

34
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.600
 to 0 so

35
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.200
X for this value is 0 x for this value is 0

36
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.100
 x for this value is 0 x for this value is 2

37
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.700
 X for this value is 2 X for this is equal to 1.

38
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.300
Okay, so now we know that random variable.

39
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.100
It's going to ask us what is the

40
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.600
 probability distribution of x?

41
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.100
What is the probability distribution of x?

42
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.400
I'm going to jump right to the notation. I'm going to click on reveal answer.

43
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.700
 I'm going to explain the notification to you.

44
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
Peter what PSP is the notation for probability

45
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.700
 if you want to know the probability of something you write the letter p

46
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.300
Then the thing for what you want to measure is probably pass it between the

47
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.800
 parentheses.

48
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.300
Here just focus on this part for a moment.

49
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.500
You're asking. What is the probability?

50
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.600
That the random variable X.

51
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.500
will have

52
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.600
zero defects

53
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.200
We already know that the random variable has.

54
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.500
This many defects for all six slots.

55
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.500
What is the probability that you would pick one randomly like one lot

56
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.900
 randomly?

57
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.200
And there will be no defects.

58
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.600
David look again.

59
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.700
So this

60
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.000
term

61
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.500
probably of x equal to 0

62
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.900
Translates to the probability that Lot

63
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.800
 1 or 3 or lot 6 have

64
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.000
 been.

65
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.500
randomly shipped to the vendor

66
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.900
Like the wind like the vendor.

67
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.300
Would be unlucky and they would receive lot one last three or lot

68
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.500
 six.

69
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.300
Excuse me. I was lucky.

70
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.400
because

71
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.200
I made a mistake lot one last three and

72
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.400
 six have no defects. Let's say they were lucky.

73
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.200
And they would they would they would receive lot one lot through

74
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.300
 lot six so they would get the shipment no defects.

75
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.600
Now they can sell it to the clients.

76
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.600
What is a probably that we there would be lucky.

77
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.300
This is the notation for probability. That's p.

78
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.100
Then we have the random variable.

79
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.000
We're asking what is it? Probably that X will be 0.

80
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.700
Well, then we know that probably we know how probably works.

81
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.100
You take the that the size of

82
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.600
 the event.

83
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.800
divided by the size of the sample space

84
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.100
Size of the event divided by the sample space so we have

85
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.600
 three lots that have no defects and we have six slots

86
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.000
 in total.

87
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.000
Three divided by 6. That's 3.5.

88
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.800
Okay.

89
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.900
You can do some algebra divide.

90
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.500
The numerator numerator and denominator by 3

91
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 and we get 1 over 2.

92
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.100
also

93
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.600
This is equivalent to this.

94
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.300
So you're asking what is the probability?

95
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.200
That he will have zero defects.

96
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.100
I want you to be familiar with both types of notations this notation

97
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.700
 here at the right.

98
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500
This notation here at the left.

99
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.000
Okay, because they're both equivalent.

100
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.800
Now let's

101
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.500
 continue. We haven't completed the probability distribution

102
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500
 of the random variable X.

103
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.300
This is when X the first one is for X when there are zero defects.

104
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.200
 What is the probability distribution?

105
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.500
Or what is the probability rather when the random variable takes

106
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.700
 some takes on the value one?

107
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.900
Like what is a probability that you would find a box?

108
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.500
with one effect

109
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.600
exactly one defect.

110
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.100
there will be similar notation for

111
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.200
For example up to one if the fact or up to

112
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.000
 10 Defector up to 1180 facts, but right now we we considered

113
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.300
 when exactly a precise value. What is

114
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.500
 the probability that X will take on the value 1?

115
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.900
So you will find the Box.

116
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.200
And you would pick a box randomly and

117
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.900
 one of them will have exactly one defect.

118
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.200
Well, then you asking for pot a lot number four.

119
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.500
 Why Lot Number Four because Lot Number Four has exactly one

120
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.000
 defect.

121
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.500
So we have one defect or one box out of

122
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.300
 how many boxes six.

123
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.600
And of course by now, you should know the probability formula you take

124
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.400
 the size of the event.

125
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.000
remember

126
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.400
here we have lots but we in probability we

127
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.300
 call them events the boxes that this box is an event. This box

128
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.300
 is an event Xbox, isn't it? Why is it called an event?

129
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.100
Because you're picking it randomly and you're sending it over. It's it's like

130
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.400
 flipping a coin you're taking a chance when you pick

131
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.400
 up something randomly, and you're not expecting the the box

132
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.100
 to see what's inside.

133
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.000
You're taking a chance.

134
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.300
So we brings us to a question. What is it? Probably that you'd pick

135
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.200
 up one of those bucks and they will have exactly one defect one out of

136
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.300
 six.

137
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.600
Just like rolling the dice.

138
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.400
Zero point and you know, of course if you calculate this

139
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.700
 or convert this fraction to decimal it gives you the point six seven.

140
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.100
and of course

141
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.200
x equals to same same story. What is the chance

142
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.500
 or what is the probability that you would pick up two boxes?

143
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.900
And or you would pack pick up any box.

144
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.200
and

145
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.100
they will be exactly two defects. Well, since we have

146
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.500
 two boxes where to defects that would be two for six and it

147
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.600
 the answer is 0.3.
