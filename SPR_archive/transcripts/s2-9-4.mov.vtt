00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.400
So now what we want to do is calculate calculate what

1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.600
 the CDF?

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.600
Now that we've managed to standardize our normal distribution we can

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.200
 use CDF.

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.800
and if you want to denote CDF

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.000
like I said

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.300
P uppercase

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.600
so what are we taking or what

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.100
 is the argument that you're passing to

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.500
 CDF to our CDF? What are we trying to measure we are

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.900
 trying to measure.

11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.600
both machines

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.700
But let's do the first one.

13
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800
What? Okay. What is the

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.800
So we want to know what is the probability?

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.200
that

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.200
Z sub 1

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.900
What is the probability that Z sub 1?

18
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.100
or false somewhere between

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.100
a that's 2.9 centimeters and

20
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.700
B that's 3.1 centimeters the

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.700
 experiments when this machine starts producing

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.400
 corks one after the other after the other after the

23
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.500
 other

24
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100
What is the probability?

25
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.500
that

26
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.000
it will have quirks that will fall within 2.9 centimeters

27
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 and 3.1 centimeters.

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.400
And then we will do the same thing again.

29
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.400
for the second machine

30
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.800
So let's put them to the test.

31
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
Now we know what kind of question Depot was

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.100
 mathematically that Z sub one. Let's focus on

33
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.000
 the first machine. These sub one is between 2.9 3.1

34
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.700
 now because we standardized

35
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.900
x sub 1 to Z sub 1 using the standard transformation.

36
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.500
Formula, we also have to standardize.

37
00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.800
A and B

38
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.200
we have to standardize these these tools have

39
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.000
 to be adjusted for

40
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.300
the transformation

41
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.500
Okay.

42
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.500
Which means we will have to re-express this.

43
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.500
The same way as the in a similar way we expressed.

44
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.200
What do you call it?

45
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.100
Z sub 1

46
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.200
so this will be changed to it's actually

47
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.800
 bring this in here.

48
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.100
That's actually bring this into here.

49
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.900
So we have to standardize.

50
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.900
A and B so we go p

51
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.100
over Sigma

52
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
okay, subtract both numbers by the population mean

53
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.000
of course the population mean for the first machine.

54
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.900
The first machine has a standard deviation

55
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.900
 3 and excuse me mean three standard deviation.

56
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.300
What is it 0.1?

57
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.400
Okay, so mu is not.

58
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.100
It's not fixed.

59
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.400
Mu and sigma will be different for Z1 and there

60
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.300
 will be different for Z2.

61
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100
Okay, so let's begin. Let's be careful with that.

62
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.600
Okay. So now we've standardized around

63
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.300
 the variable. We've standardized the

64
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.800
the range in which we want.

65
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.000
the corks to

66
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.500
Fall in now. We can actually go ahead and bring in

67
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.100
 the five function.

68
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.800
to calculate

69
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.300
the probability

70
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.300
now I'm not going to type everything in here because I think you have the idea.

71
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.600
 Let me just do the same thing for

72
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.100
the second machine

73
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.700
second machine. I'm in second.

74
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.500
random variable

75
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.200
for these up to

76
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.000
okay will be the same one except this was these up to

77
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.200
okay, and now let's go ahead

78
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.300
 and

79
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.400
I would reveal the answer because the answer has

80
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.200
 everything typed in nicely.

81
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.400
And we'll take it from there.
