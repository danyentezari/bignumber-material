00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.000
so if we now move on to the next example

1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.600
this one has to do with

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.300
power stations

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.700
for electric cars

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.100
Maybe some of your fans of Tesla.

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.700
but here is

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.000
the idea

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.100
Okay, we will look at this.

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.600
example problem to understand

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.400
the notation of the random variable the concept of the random variable

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.900
 and the application of the random variable.

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.900
So let's let's look at this. Let's look at the story and see what it's about at the

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.400
 airport. There are two recharge stations for electric cars.

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.200
Okay, so instead of a petrol station.

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.600
you have to

15
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.200
recharge stations for electric cars

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.700
at both recharge stations

17
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.200
There are four Chargers.

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.500
so instead of having pumps you have

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.900
you know like this huge.

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400
Power supply with the cable that like a USB a

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.600
 USB cable that goes into your car.

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.700
Each station has four of them at the airport.

23
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.100
Maybe have one for the arrival section one for the

24
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.700
 departure section. We are going to see more of these by the way.

25
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.400
But now let's consider an experiment.

26
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.300
Where the number of numbers of chargers are

27
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.500
 in use at both of the stations?

28
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.600
Okay, for example in one experiment.

29
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.100
We have 13 and 40. What does this mean?

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.100
Let's say you're looking at the camera.

31
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.400
You're looking through the camera to see how many cars are at the

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.300
 station in one station.

33
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.000
one charger is being

34
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.600
consumed and three Chargers being consumed. Let's say

35
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.100
 in the arrival Section 3 cars are using the Chargers.

36
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.500
the other station

37
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.300
for the departures

38
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.000
four charges and two Chargers are being used. That's what these numbers

39
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.300
 mean.

40
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.500
Okay.

41
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.400
So here we have six charges that are actively being used.

42
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.000
six charges are

43
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.700
active at post station at the same time.

44
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.400
in the sample space

45
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.100
entirety of the outcome

46
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.500
There are 25 possible outcomes in

47
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.700
 any given experiment.

48
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.200
So I said an experiment can be rolling a dice flipping a

49
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.000
 coin but here it can be a day or

50
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.900
 a particular hour.

51
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.200
Or cars are parked at the stations and they're charging

52
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.600
 their their cars.

53
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.400
25 possible outcomes

54
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.300
from any given experiment and you're listening table

55
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.500
 below.

56
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.100
And let's see and I'll tell you what, this is. So let's zoom in here for

57
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.400
 a second.

58
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.900
So for example

59
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.800
It could be.

60
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.600
This is for station one and Station 2. It could be that at

61
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.100
 station one.

62
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.300
Where you have the departures, there's one car and only one car

63
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.700
 is charging their.

64
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.800
car

65
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.500
and if you look at the

66
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.100
Recharge station at the arrival section. There's no car.

67
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.600
That's why you have one and zero.

68
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.600
We have to count the zeros to in the sample space because it could be that it

69
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.200
 could be that there are no cars in either station.

70
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.000
or for example

71
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.400
We look at this this cell in

72
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.500
 the table.

73
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.400
right

74
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.700
where

75
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.700
three chargers at station two are being used and three chargers

76
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.900
 at station one are being used.

77
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.800
now if we count all of these

78
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.300
outcomes

79
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.900
There will be 25.

80
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.900
25 including

81
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.100
zero and zero

82
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.500
where neither of the morphine used

83
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.200
Okay. Now, let's see what the what the problem is asking us

84
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.400
 to do.

85
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.700
assume an experiment

86
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.100
s is performed.

87
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.000
Meaning this experiment takes place where you have

88
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.200
 cars driving to the stations.

89
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.900
assume

90
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.900
that

91
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.600
an experiment is performed and outcome is

92
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.600
two three

93
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.300
So two charges at station one is a being

94
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.100
 used in three charges at Station

95
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.900
 2 is being used.

96
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.800
Okay, cool. That's that's our experiment.

97
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.400
now Define three random variables

98
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.000
where

99
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.200
so these are three random variables notice how they're all uppercase.

100
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.200
X

101
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.400
Contains the total number of charges in use at both stations.

102
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.300
Why the difference between the numbers of charges at

103
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.100
 both in both stations Station 1 versus session two

104
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.300
 and Z the maximum number of charges in active use

105
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.500
 at the both state at both stations. Think about this think about

106
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.100
 these problems for a few seconds. Think about the

107
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.400
 first one start with the first one. How do you how would you go about solving

108
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.700
 this problem?
