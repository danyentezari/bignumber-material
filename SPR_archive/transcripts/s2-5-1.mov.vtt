now

1
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.100
p

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.400
refers to the probability function

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.700
 uppercase p with parentheses refers to the probability function.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.300
 Let's quickly jump to the previous example, where

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.600
 we where we're talking about there. Probably Mass function.

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.500
And let me quickly, correct this equal sign that equal sign shouldn't

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.900
 be there. It's confusing.

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.600
So we want to go into.

9
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Probability normal distribution, let me get rid of that equal

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.000
 sign.

11
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.200
Yeah much better. So whenever you see this whenever she

12
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.200
 uppercase p with parentheses.

13
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.300
That's the probability function.

14
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.800
Okay. So let's first look at the previous example,

15
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.100
 so we can understand why we have this situation.

16
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.900
Why we have an inequality.

17
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.600
as the argument

18
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.200
for they probably Mass function.

19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.300
So let's jump to

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.000
the example for the pmf

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.600
probability Mass function

22
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm just going to jump to the answer just to remind you.

23
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.300
 Hopefully you've all watched the video or you attended the

24
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.100
 session before so you don't have to we don't have to go through these examples again,

25
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.300
 but when you when you type in

26
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.100
 P what parentheses and then you pass to it some argument.

27
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.900
You're saying what is the probability?

28
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.000
Mass function of that particular situation

29
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.900
Here we're saying what is the probability of x?

30
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.500
taking on the value 0

31
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.300
Okay. Another one is here we have what

32
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.500
 is the probability that X will take on the value 1?

33
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.000
And then what you would do.

34
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.900
Is you would calculate the probabilities corresponding

35
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.600
 to that X. So for example up here?

36
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.200
One X equals to 1

37
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.000
Yeah, so for example.

38
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.800
This this example was about six boxes.

39
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.000
Six boxes containing some mechanical

40
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.400
 parts and some of those boxes

41
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.400
 had defects. So for example box number one

42
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.600
 has zero defects box. Number two had two defects box.

43
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.400
 Number three had zero defects also but walks number

44
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.300
 four this particular box one defect there were

45
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.800
 some mechanical parts of that box one of the most effective. So this here

46
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.300
 when we look at the probability Mass function we asking what is

47
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.000
 the probability

48
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.800
That one of those boxes would be defective.

49
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.100
Okay.

50
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.600
And we do the probability if you remember the basic probability that comes

51
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 up to 0.67.

52
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.600
Okay, that's what they probably Mass function is.

53
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
Now there's another one that uses the same

54
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.500
 notation that uses the same letter P. This is important call the

55
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.600
 cumulative distribution function.

56
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.500
cumulative distribution function

57
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200
except with the

58
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.300
Cumulative distribution of function we don't use just

59
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.400
 we don't use the equal sign we use the inequality.

60
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.900
So less than or equal or greater than or equal.

61
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.400
So for example, here's another example these correspond the

62
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.700
 the Y's.

63
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.300
the Y's here

64
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.800
are the

65
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.000
the experiments

66
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.700
within the random variable y uppercase Y

67
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.500
 is the random variable small Y is the experiment.

68
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.800
So, for example, we have one experiment.

69
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.700
where this was about flash drives, by the way one experiment

70
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.200
 you have

71
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.500
This is a the first experiment is when

72
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.400
 the when the flash drive is one GB. The second

73
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.200
 experiment was is when the flash drive is 2GB. The third

74
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.300
 experiment is when the flash drive

75
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.300
 is 4GB and so on. Okay the probability

76
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.500
 that

77
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.700
The first experiment will happen that is

78
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.200
 to say the first a flash drive of

79
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.500
 1GB will be sold is 5% the probability that for

80
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.200
 example an HGB flash

81
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.900
 drive will be sold is 40% Okay, the cumulative

82
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.000
 distribution function wants to know

83
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.100
 or asks.

84
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.300
What is the probability as you add them up? So for

85
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.700
 example here we have we're asking.

86
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
What is the probability that random variable

87
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.100
 will be less than or equal to 4?

88
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.500
that is to say

89
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.000
experiment experiment one experiment experiment one

90
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.400
 or experiment to or experimentary or experiment

91
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.200
 4 will happen.

92
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.200
Okay, this is one experiment another experiment third experiment for

93
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.500
 experiment we're asking what is the probability the cumulative

94
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.300
 probability that these four experiments? What

95
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.400
 happened?

96
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.400
Well, if you want to know the probability that all four of these experiments will

97
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 happen you simply add up their corresponding probability. You add

98
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.800
 0.5.

99
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.900
Plus 0.1.35 plus

100
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.100
 4 you add up those probabilities and you get the

101
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.500
 cumulative distribution or excuse me, the cumulative

102
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.800
 probability 4.

103
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.000
all of these for experiments
