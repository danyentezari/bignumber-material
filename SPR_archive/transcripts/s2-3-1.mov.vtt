00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.700
We will be looking at some calculus notation. Now.

1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.300
 We want delve to in delve too much into calculus.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.200
but

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.300
you know, it's something we have to talk about.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.500
And where possible we will leave it. We will use calculators

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
 to do things like derivatives and

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.600
 integration very quickly. Let's talk

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.100
 about the two major Concepts in calculus.

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.200
differentiation integration

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300
Okay, so even if like I said and if you're not familiar with

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.400
 Calculus or you do not remember calculus at

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.200
 all. Don't worry about it. Like I said, we will look at the notation, but we

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.900
 won't do much.

13
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.300
You know operations with Calculus. We will skip to the value. We'll skip

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.800
 to the results.

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.300
So what are the two major Concepts and calculus?

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.100
The first one is differentiation.

17
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.900
Okay, I'm gonna get to why?

18
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.400
we have to

19
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.600
You know talk about this.

20
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.000
the idea of differentiation

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.800
and calculus

22
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.900
is

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.600
to find

24
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.800
the

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.800
this slope

26
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.400
of a point

27
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.700
at a curve

28
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.100
see if we will if we were trying to find the slope of

29
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.600
you know straight.

30
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000
Lines, it wouldn't be a problem.

31
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.200
But what curve it's a bit problematic?

32
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.400
Now without getting too deep into differentiation

33
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.500
 and limits and

34
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.400
 the notation all of that. The point of differentiation is

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.200
 simply Define this point to find a particular

36
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 point at a curve and that is referred to as the gradient. That's number one.

37
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.400
What we more concerned with.

38
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.300
is integration in this

39
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.100
in this Workshop in the context of continuous probability distributions.

40
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.200
We work considered with integration.

41
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.500
Which is the second part the second major Concept in calculus?

42
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.500
So whereas differentiation is about finding the

43
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.100
 gradient.

44
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.700
of a curve

45
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.700
the line

46
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.300
integration is about measuring the area.

47
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.600
Under that very same curve.

48
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.700
So what is the area?

49
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.300
Of this particular region, if this was

50
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.200
 again, if this if we were looking at straight shapes, it wouldn't be

51
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.400
 a problem.

52
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.400
But with curved we have to we have

53
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.800
 to take a

54
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.400
you know, we have to do it in a special way.

55
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.400
As a matter of fact the idea is that you would take

56
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.600
let's say this area.

57
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.600
the one indicated by these red boxes

58
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.200
and then you would zoom into that area. You would zoom into

59
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.000
 that area and you would create these slices so

60
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.500
he would take for example this Regional use my

61
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500
 Marquee tool you would take this area.

62
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.900
 For example.

63
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.600
You would slice it.

64
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.100
And then you would slice it further and then slice it some

65
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.700
 more and that's nice to some more you will keep on going like this infinitely.

66
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.400
Until your slice is so thin.

67
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.000
it's so thin that

68
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.600
the top part of that slice is

69
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.700
virtually straight

70
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.400
Okay.

71
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.400
And you keep on doing this repeatedly over

72
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.300
 and over and over until you have covered the entire area

73
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.100
 that you're trying to calculate with these thin slices and then

74
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.300
 you add those slices up.

75
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.200
And that's how you get these service. That's how

76
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.600
 you get the area of under the Curve.

77
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.000
Now we may have a workshop where we talk about calculus exclusively

78
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.300
 and trigonometry, of course in a

79
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.700
 separate Workshop. But you know today is about statistics and probability Theory

80
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.300
 so we won't get it that very much, but I just

81
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.000
 want to remind you.

82
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.700
What in differentiation integration are

83
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.900
 about?

84
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700
And how we will help us.

85
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.000
with continuous

86
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.900
probability distributions
