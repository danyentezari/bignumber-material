Statistics gives us the power to make inferences.

1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.000
When we say inference.

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.100
We can mean two things.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.200
Either making inferences about some relationship.

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.800
For example the relationship between salary and experience.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.100
Is it the case that the more experience they

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.200
 have? They can demand a higher salary the second thing

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.800
 could mean.

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.600
Is forecasting for example, we can use statistics

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.300
 to forecast future sales.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.400
Or the future number of tourists in the

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.400
 city.

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.500
Or how much traffic you could expect on a highway and so

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.700
 everything that we are going to look at in this course we'll have

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.000
 to do with how statistics helps us understand relationships

15
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.200
 within data.

16
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.700
and how to make forecasts

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.200
based on

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.500
existing data and three main topics that

19
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.600
 we are going to understand and great detail include regression

20
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000
 analysis hypothesis testing

21
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.800
 and the Bayesian theorem. Now,

22
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 the reason why I have bay z and Theorem in the

23
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.300
 second half of this

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.100
screen here is because the first two topics are

25
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.200
 techniques within classical statistics classical

26
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
 statistics or as it's also known

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 frequently statistics the third major topic that

28
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.300
 we will discuss in this course.

29
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.400
Which is the Bayesian theorem, it's fundamentally different from how

30
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.200
 frequently statistics works. We'll talk

31
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.700
 about the difference between frequent statistics.

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400
and Bayesian statistics in a separate

33
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.300
 video the first three modules

34
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.800
Are dedicated to the frequentist?

35
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.500
statistical techniques

36
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.000
and the fourth module Bayesian statistics

37
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.100
There will also be a fifth module which will of course

38
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.300
 Talk About Time series.
