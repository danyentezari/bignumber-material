00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.900
now, let's look at

1
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.400
the bz and Theorem again because this time we

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.000
 are going to use

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.600
the

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.500
formula the actual formula for

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.000
or to arrive at that quantity.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.500
They will look at before that 28%

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.000
the Bayesian

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.600
theorem

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.600
the formula for it rather

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.900
can we express different ways algebraically?

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.400
Which is why we want to look at at least two approaches.

12
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.600
The first one will actually use this form of

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.700
 the Bayesian theorem.

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700
The other one will use What's called the odds

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.300
 and likelihood ratios.

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.600
and the book

17
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.400
to which I was referring.

18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.100
Use it this uses the second approach.

19
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.400
So even though this exercise is from the book. I will first show

20
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.000
 you my

21
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.500
adaptation of that example

22
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.200
using the this very well known formula.

23
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.200
And in the second approach we'll look at the approach that the book

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.500
 takes.

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.800
Although the book doesn't actually use much mathematical notation.

26
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.700
I'm going to write it out for you. Just so that you know that.

27
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.300
There are different ways we can arrive at that same number algebraically.

28
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.000
Now what I have done here is I've

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.500
replaced A and B with

30
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.800
age sub G and T sub P respectively. So

31
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.900
 H is hypothesis the guilty hypothesis.

32
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.400
And T is test positive test. So the

33
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.000
 question was what is the probability?

34
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.900
of the athlete being guilty

35
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.700
given

36
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.400
their test result was positive

37
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.200
So the probability of being guilty given a positive test.

38
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.100
We want to find out.

39
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.000
the marginal

40
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.400
and Joint probabilities

41
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.000
and then plug in the values.

42
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200
So this is the first approach.

43
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.500
So now let's go ahead and see how we can calculate the marginal and

44
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.700
 Joint probabilities for

45
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.200
this formula

46
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.100
and let me pull up the figure just

47
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.400
 so we can.

48
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.800
Let me pull up that figure so we can see where we are getting.

49
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.500
these numbers from

50
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.300
now we start by finding out how many

51
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.000
 tests were positive.

52
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.900
And how many tests were negative?

53
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.500
And then so we find a modular probabilities first because the

54
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.600
 information is right here.

55
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.400
And then we can figure out the joint probabilities.

56
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.200
just to make it clear where I got these numbers from

57
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.000
let me at the fraction.

58
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.000
There we go.

59
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.700
now

60
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.900
How do we know how many?

61
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.600
How do we know the probability of testing positive? Well, we

62
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.600
 have it here right 68 athletes tested positive

63
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.100
 and that's 68 over 1000.

64
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.200
So 1,000

65
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.300
Is the number of athletes who both tested

66
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.900
 positive and who tested negative?

67
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.700
So 68 over 68 plus 932 or

68
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.400
 we can just say 68 over 1,000.

69
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.400
So we get about seven percent about seven percent.

70
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.000
of athletes tested positively

71
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.200
At 93 almost 93% of

72
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.700
 athletes tested negative again.

73
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400
We take 932 divided by 1,000.

74
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.900
and of course these two probabilities

75
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.200
add up to one.

76
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.600
Now, let's see how we can acquire these joint probabilities.

77
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.500
again with the first column

78
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.400
We want to go to the athletes who tested positive

79
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.200
 really positively and we want to see.

80
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.200
What is the probability of that athlete having

81
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.700
 been guilty?

82
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.100
So that's just

83
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.100
19 over 1,000

84
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400
19 athletes tested positively

85
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.400
19 athletes tested positively

86
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.500
and they were actually doping so that's 19 over

87
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.200
 1,000.

88
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.800
and 49 athletes

89
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.200
Tested positively.

90
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.300
But they were innocent.

91
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.000
That's the second hypothesis here.

92
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.700
so the probability of testing positive

93
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.200
and being innocent

94
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.600
Is 49 over 1000?

95
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.500
Because they tested positively right they tested positively.

96
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.400
But they are actually innocent.

97
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.700
So the probability of

98
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500
testing positively

99
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.700
and

100
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.000
being innocent all over the total number of possible outcomes.

101
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.200
All over the total number of possible outcomes.

102
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.900
So keep this in mind that 1,000 remember?

103
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.600
Is the total number of possible outcomes?

104
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.300
And then while we don't need the negative

105
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.600
 column.

106
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.600
For approach number one, it's good

107
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.800
 to have this in here. It's good to have this here for reference.

108
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.900
So if you look at the negative.

109
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.000
branch

110
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.200
931 are innocent

111
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.500
and they tested negatively. So that's 931 over

112
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.100
 1000.

113
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.200
one athlete tested positively

114
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.100
Excuse me, one athlete was guilty.

115
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.400
When they even though they tested negatively.

116
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.200
Okay.

117
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.100
and of course if we add up these if we had a

118
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.400
if we add a diffractions in this row.

119
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.000
We get this sum and again this these two sums

120
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.700
 add up to one.

121
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.900
So this is you always want to check.

122
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.700
the sum to make sure

123
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.000
And that's how you make sure the values are correct?

124
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600
With this table we can now calculate.

125
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.500
the relevant

126
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.300
marginal and joint problem probabilities. I say relevant because

127
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.400
 we're not really concerned with the second column.

128
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.100
Not just yet.

129
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.800
So we just want to know what is the probability of testing positively what is

130
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800
 a probability of being guilty?

131
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.800
And what is the probability of testing positively?

132
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.100
And being guilty and we have that information up here in the

133
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.200
 table.

134
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.300
Now we can use these values to plug them into our

135
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.700
 formula.

136
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.400
So again, this is the Bayesian.

137
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.700
theorem

138
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.100
this is what the Bayesian theorem tells us.

139
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.300
now over here we have the product of

140
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.200
the conditional probability

141
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.300
and the marginal probability or

142
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.000
they are also known as the likelihood.

143
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.700
and the odds

144
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.000
Now we don't have this conditional probability now table.

145
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.400
But we do know that this expression is

146
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.100
 equivalent to that expression.

147
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.500
If you need to remember this you can watch the

148
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.100
 previous videos.

149
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.100
So we can express this.

150
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.500
Product as the joint probability of testing positively and guilty,

151
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.500
 but we have that value.

152
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.600
Right there.

153
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.300
And we also have the value for the marginal probability for testing positively.

154
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.400
So all we need to do then is just plug in these numbers.

155
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.200
Which gives us this fraction?

156
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.100
Evaluating we get 28%

157
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.400
This is the algebraic way of solving.

158
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200
this particular problem

159
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.400
now in practice you might have to

160
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.000
spend some time.

161
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.800
Drawing out this table drawing out

162
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.400
 the tree.

163
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.300
Going over this table, like it will be very helpful.

164
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.200
 If you actually plug in these values because there's a

165
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.700
 lot going on.

166
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.500
and you can

167
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.300
lose track

168
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.800
of what you're doing.

169
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.000
And in fact, I did I had to go over this a few times to make sure.

170
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.700
that the table

171
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.400
of marginal and Joint probabilities is a correct

172
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.100
 reflection of the tree.

173
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.500
So when you're doing something like this expect yourself to

174
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.500
 spend some time.

175
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.700
to help properly collect all the information
