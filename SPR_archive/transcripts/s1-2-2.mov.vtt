00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.900
We will start with.

1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.800
two

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.500
key terms

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.900
two key terms

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.000
they were of course be other key terms that will be aware of but we will begin

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.700
 with the word population.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.500
and Sample

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.800
We will come across many formulas.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.200
But there will be two variants for each

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.700
 of these formulas that we will look at.

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.300
There will be one formula for this thing. We

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.700
 call population and a similar formula for

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.700
 thing called sample.

13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.700
So

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.100
we will have formulas for the for

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.400
 the set of

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.200
topics that fall under population and similar formula that

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.900
 fall into the set of sample.

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.800
I am going to guess that some of you have probably seen one

19
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.400
 formula for example standard deviation

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.300
 and then you come across another one.

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.400
And they look different and you go. Wait a minute. I thought this is the formula for standard deviation

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.500
 that what is this? Probably looking at the standard

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.100
 deviation of a population and the other example you

24
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 were looking at was a popular standard deviation for sample.
