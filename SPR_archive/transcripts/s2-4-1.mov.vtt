00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.900
But why do we?

1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.300
concern ourselves with the integration

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.200
because what you're looking at right now on the screen is this is

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.900
 the normal distribution. It looks something like this.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.300
This is the classical build curve. It's a very

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.700
 important.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.100
Probability distribution. In fact we can

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.300
 argue that it's the most

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.600
important over distribution

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.500
I'll give you examples why it's important and we'll

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.300
 also look at the formula for the normal

11
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.000
 distribution. It's one of the most important formulas

12
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.700
 in all of mathematics up

13
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.100
 there with E equals MC squared and

14
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.200
you know Newton's laws of physics. It's

15
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.600
 so important and that's why it will

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.900
 be the main focus of today's.

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.300
Workshop

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.700
But as you can see the normal distribution.

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.300
When plotted on a

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.200
 graph looks just like that graph. I showed

21
00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.400
 you earlier.

22
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.600
When we were looking at the integration slide.

23
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.400
So what we want to do, for example with the discrete probability

24
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.200
 distribution, it was much easier to calculate.

25
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.300
the area now we didn't

26
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.400
 look at the

27
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.900
area of a discrete probability distribution

28
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.300
But it's not curved.

29
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.900
It's not curve.

30
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.700
I'll show you a quick. I'll show you a picture very quickly.

31
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.300
Just the

32
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.200
this is from week. This is from what some website but here it

33
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 is.

34
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.300
If you look at this graph.

35
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.100
This is a discrete probability distribution. Just a simple rectangular

36
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 ships much easier to measure.

37
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.200
the area when you know

38
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.200
They're none when they're not curved.

39
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
Okay, but because the normal probability

40
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.300
 distribution is continuous which makes it curved.

41
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.600
Or we use integration which will give us this ability to

42
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 measure its area.

43
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.700
And that's that's that was my point with talking podcasts.

44
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.100
 So if you figure if you ever wonder why is it

45
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.300
 that would with with discrete random variables? We

46
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
 don't talk about calculus, but then when we talk about continuous roundabouts we

47
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 have to do calculus well.

48
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.600
It's because of the shape of continuous probability

49
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.300
 distributions so very much. It's

50
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.700
 a mouthful when I have to say continuous probably

51
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.900
 distribution, but I have to because

52
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
We do have.

53
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.000
two types of random variables

54
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.300
and each random and both random variables have

55
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400
their own probability distribution
