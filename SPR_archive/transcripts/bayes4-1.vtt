00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so let's have a

1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.400
 look at this.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.800
this

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.100
figure represents

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.600
the probability tree

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.700
for two events

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.900
Where the events are just flipping two coins?

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.500
And we have four possible outcomes from flipping two coins.

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.700
Either we get two heads or two tails.

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.700
or a tails in the head

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
or heads and a tails.

11
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.300
Now you remember this again calculating probability

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.900
 is very simple.

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.200
chosen number of outcomes over the total possible number

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.800
 of outcomes

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.400
So obviously if you if you want to know what is a probability

16
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.500
 of getting two heads.

17
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.600
There is one outcome. We have four possible outcomes.

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.400
 So that's one over four.

19
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.500
Okay, and if we are particular about

20
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.100
 the order?

21
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.500
In which we get a heads or tails. Well, then we

22
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.700
 would have two separate outcomes.

23
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.600
So getting a tails and heads.

24
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.300
Or a heads on the Tails. These are considered two

25
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.900
 separate outcomes.

26
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.300
now, let's see why we don't want to add and why we

27
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.700
 have to multiply

28
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
the straight line represents one coin

29
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.000
the possible outcomes of the first coin

30
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.600
the dashed lines represent the possible

31
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.800
 outcomes of the second coin.

32
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.200
If we flip the first coin.

33
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.900
Now we get ahead.

34
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.000
the other coin

35
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.400
also has two other possible outcomes.

36
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.600
So let's say we flip the second out we flip the second coin.

37
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.100
Which also has 50% probability and we get a heads.

38
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.900
if we count

39
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.400
these two numbers or I should say if we add these two numbers.

40
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.900
we get a 1

41
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.500
or a hundred percent probability which doesn't

42
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.800
 make sense.

43
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.600
But if you multiply 50.5 times 0.5

44
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.300
 we get 25.

45
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.200
0.25

46
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.200
which does make sense?

47
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.300
the point of multiplying

48
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.600
is to

49
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200
account for

50
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.700
all the possible outcomes multiplication is

51
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600
another way to add

52
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.800
or I should say multiplication is a

53
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.100
 sequence of addition operations.

54
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.800
So this is one.

55
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.200
perspective
