okay, now now that we know now that we

1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.200
 know how the Phi function works and

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.200
how that we have to integrate the five

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.800
 function to

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.400
calculate the probability for the

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.000
 randomized random variable. Let's go ahead and apply this idea to

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.200
The exercise so go back here.

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.400
now

8
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.200
instead of using word from

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.200
 alpha each time you want to calculate?

10
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.900
five function

11
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.700
the normal distribution is the normal distribution

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.900
 is

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.700
I don't want to use the port standard.

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.800
But it's it's it's probability. These are our Universal.

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.200
So rather than calculating it by hand

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.700
 or

17
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.300
programmatically just look up the table. So for example

18
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.700
 if I opened up the z-score.

19
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.400
If I open up the the table for this course.

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.600
It will tell you that for example if you want to know.

21
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.400
five function the value five function

22
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.700
 for the value set of negative 1

23
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.100
it's 1.5866. And that's where we

24
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.700
 calculate it, right?

25
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.200
and if it's not precisely one, but it's like

26
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.400
1.01 1.021.03 then

27
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.900
 you can look up the row to find.

28
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.100
You know.

29
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.400
That probably for that particular.

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.600
You know value.

31
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.400
so

32
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.700
we will use this table.

33
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.300
to calculate

34
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.200
the CDF of

35
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
our you know problem.
