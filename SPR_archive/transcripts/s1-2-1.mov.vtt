00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.700
So let's begin with mathematical thinking.

1
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.700
Before we do begin talking about statistics. I

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.600
 want you to know.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000
That we will come across. Well, there will be two things.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.900
That you need to be aware of.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.100
That will be an obstacle.

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.200
in

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.200
our Learning Journey two things will be our obstacles.

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.300
One of them is of course the mathematical rotation. I'm sure.

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.700
Many of you are attending this session because you've probably

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.800
 had your try at learning statistics.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.500
You've found some books some blogs some articles and

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.700
 videos.

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.300
That wasn't sufficient. So it's you know what? Let me let me attend this workshop

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.100
 and maybe I'll have a better luck here. So one is

15
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.300
 the mathematical notation. That's one obstacle.

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.200
the second obstacle

17
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.000
or the terms themselves

18
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.400
and I'm showing you only your small sample of the many

19
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.200
 words that you have either you're seeing on the screen here, but

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.600
what I'm trying to

21
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.800
highlight here is this

22
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.800
some of these words

23
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.100
Are words that you have seen?

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.000
Or you're familiar with because they're part of

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200
 your English vernacular. Now that doesn't matter

26
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.700
 if English is your first language or second language or third language, but if

27
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.400
 you see these words

28
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.700
You are you would you tend to

29
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.900
 associate them with?

30
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.300
words that are used in English in general

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.300
and I want you to know that we will come across words that

32
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.200
 you already know in English, but you must try to disassociate them

33
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.100
 with English because

34
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.700
when you see a word

35
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.100
and I will they will be highlighting a certain way when you see

36
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.200
 those words understand that you're looking at a word in

37
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.000
 statistics that has nothing to do.

38
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.700
What that word in English for example?

39
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.400
You look at the word.

40
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.400
Moment.

41
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.500
This is one of the tricky one especially for beginners.

42
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.900
He tend to think about time.

43
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.000
Duration that kind of thing it has nothing to do.

44
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200
With time whatsoever.

45
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.200
Another one is

46
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.400
the word

47
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700
population

48
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.400
You know we tend to think about people population of

49
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.500
 people.

50
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.000
again in statistics

51
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.700
That is a more General meaning.

52
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.500
Okay, now we will get into these definitions of course, but I want to set that.

53
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200
Set that expectation from now on so you should

54
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.900
 expect to start relearning or

55
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.500
 unlearning some of the words with which you

56
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.100
 are already familiar.
