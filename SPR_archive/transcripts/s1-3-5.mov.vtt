00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.500
I want you to know where the term statistics comes

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.600
 from.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.300
Because if you want to remember the word statistic.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.400
Like you, you know the meaning of statistic.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.800
That will even help you.

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.000
become more interested in learning the

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.900
the formulas

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.700
when we are let's go back one second to the concept of sample on

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.900
 population.

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.100
If I can go all the way back here.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.100
Again, remember we we use the sample to get

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.700
 to the population.

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.100
You will get the sample to get to the population.

13
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
 Now. There is also topic that has to with how you select.

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.300
A sample that's called sampling and that's something we will leave

15
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.700
 for the Third.

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.100
For the third day, okay.

17
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.300
We won't use a sample to know something about

18
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.300
 the population. So you want to look we want to look at a small

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.200
 piece of the story so we can do something about

20
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 the entirety of the story.

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.600
Well, if you want to learn something about the population using the

22
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.400
 sample, there are different things you want to know about the population.

23
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.100
things like standard deviation

24
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.600
Variance mean mode expected

25
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.900
 value probably distribution and

26
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 on and on and on.

27
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.000
There will be a standard deviation for a population. Like I said.

28
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.200
in a standard deviation, for example

29
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.400
The word mean variance standard deviation expected value

30
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.800
 and so on.

31
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.900
these terms

32
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.300
these particular terms

33
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.600
are individually called a statistic.

34
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.400
Okay variance is a statistic mean is a

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.200
 statistic expected value is a statistic.

36
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.000
well

37
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.200
I I think you can now see where the name

38
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.500
 comes from.

39
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200
right if all we're concerned with if

40
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.600
if we want to know all of these.

41
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.300
things

42
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.200
if you want everything there's still about each and every word you'll love

43
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 each and individual statistic when it makes sense to call

44
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 the field statistics.

45
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.900
Okay.

46
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100
So we would use the standard variance to

47
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.200
 know something about the population the excuse me. We want to know something

48
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.400
 about the sample variance.

49
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.700
to know something about the population variance

50
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.600
You want to know something about the standard expected value

51
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.200
 and the sample expected value to know

52
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.000
 something about the population?

53
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.600
standard value

54
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.400
If in the content I need to I

55
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 need to Define these now because once we get into the exercises

56
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.200
 and the examples.

57
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.300
knowing these terminology

58
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.100
It's important. Otherwise, you will be you'll be lost.

59
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.800
If we're talking about a sample.

60
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.100
Like the mean of a sample the variance of a sample.

61
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.400
The expected value of a sample. We call that a statistic.

62
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.800
However, if you're talking about the mean of a population the variance

63
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.300
 of a population expect the value of a population we call

64
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.100
 that a parameter.

65
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.800
Keep that in mind.
