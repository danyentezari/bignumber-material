00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.000
now in this figure

1
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.900
we've changed something.

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.000
here

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.400
Let me show you the old one the previous one.

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.300
In the previous one we had the number

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.400
 of athletes who were doping.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.100
versus those who are not doping

7
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.500
And on the right side we had.

8
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.200
Whether they were positive or negative.

9
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.500
in the second figure, however

10
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.800
Here we have whether they are positive or negative first and

11
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.800
 then whether they are doping or not doping.

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.300
In other words, we have a regrouped the quantities.

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.900
instead of having to find out how many tested

14
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.300
 positive

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.800
by taking these two numbers and looking at them separately. We

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.400
 have grouped the positive.

17
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.300
Under one branch and then we know

18
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.600
 how many are dropping in our doping.

19
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.400
setting for negative

20
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.900
We take all the negative quantities put them under one branch and then

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.400
 we divide them into whether they are doping or not doping.

22
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.100
We do this because these are the quantities.

23
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.900
That we would need.

24
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.200
to use the Bayesian formula

25
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
In the previous tree, we had to find this out.

26
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.100
You know separately we had to calculate those quantities.

27
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.400
And write them down somewhere. Whereas here they already

28
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.000
 factored in.

29
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.600
Since we are concerned about the positive tests.

30
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.800
And whether they're guilty or not.

31
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.000
We're going to look at this branch.

32
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Although of course we can answer similar question.

33
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.600
And look at the lower Branch, but we're not concerned with this quantity in

34
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.300
 this example. Just

35
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.700
If they tested a positive.

36
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.100
Are they guilty?

37
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.300
And if they are guilty how what is a probability

38
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.800
 that they are?

39
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.500
So, let's see how we can use this quantity.

40
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.000
Now first of all, let's talk about let's remind ourselves

41
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.100
 about the Bayesian.

42
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.300
theorem

43
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.900
this is the probability version of the

44
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.700
 base theorem.

45
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.200
This is the likelihood version of Base

46
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.600
 theorem.

47
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.100
This is what we call specifically the

48
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.800
 term on the left.

49
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.000
This is the posterior probability.

50
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.200
This is the posterior likelihood.

51
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.500
Why is this probability and why is this likelihood?

52
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.800
First let me tell you what.

53
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.400
Let me first give you the meaning of odds.

54
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.300
Let me first tell you what odds is and what probability is.
