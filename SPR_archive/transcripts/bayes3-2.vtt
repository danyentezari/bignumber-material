00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.100
In order to get a better sense of how good this test is.

1
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.600
We not only have to take into account.

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.800
The results that were correct?

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.600
But also the results that were incorrect.

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.100
So we have true positives and true negatives.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.100
Athletes who were genuinely not doping and athletes

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.200
 who are genuinely topping but what about those

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.300
 who were misclassified?

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.100
What about those who were accused of doping when they

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.400
 were not and what about those who were in fact opening but

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
 the evaded test?

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.700
If we put all of these numbers together, we'll

12
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.300
 get a different picture. And once again, this is how we

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.400
 calculate probability.

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500
We have all of our possible outcomes.

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
In this case all of the positive tests.

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.100
And then the actual correct positive tests.

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
Now for this particular example, we're only going

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.800
 to focus on the positive test because that's what the question is about.

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.900
Now, let me pull up that.

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.400
Figure just so we have it in front

21
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
 of us here. And this is for later. Let me just hide this

22
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.900
 for now.

23
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.000
so

24
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
19 tested positive

25
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.400
and they are actually doping.

26
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.900
However, 49 other athletes tested

27
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.100
 positive when they were actually innocent.

28
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.600
So what we do is we put

29
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.700
the true positives and the denominator

30
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
and the false positives as well.

31
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.700
The correct number of doping athletes plus the incorrect

32
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.200
 number of dolphin path athletes.

33
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.700
She gives us 68.

34
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.400
So 19 we're correctly tested positive, but

35
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.100
 49 were not anyway, we calculate this.

36
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.100
It will evaluate this expression.

37
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.100
In decimal format we get 0.28 which is equal to

38
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.800
 28%

39
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.200
So all things considered only 28% of

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.200
 athletes who are actually guilty.

41
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.800
Are going to test positive.

42
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.400
Which means 72%

43
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.900
so here we put the

44
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.600
false positive in the numerator

45
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.900
49 over 19 plus 49

46
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.500
72% are going

47
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.900
 to falsely be accused of doping.

48
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.200
So when we initially looked at this problem.

49
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.900
We thought that yeah, the test is 95% accurate.

50
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.100
 So

51
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800
95% of the athletes will be

52
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.300
correctly

53
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.700
testing positive

54
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.000
95 will be correctly testing negative.

55
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.400
But then we we did not we did not first. We may

56
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.900
 have not first considered a 5%

57
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.600
Who would test positive and other 5% who test negative?

58
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.200
incorrectly

59
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.900
So when we have 980 athletes.

60
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.900
If 5% of those falsely test

61
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.600
 positive that's going to change.

62
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.100
Let's go to change that's going to say different things about the

63
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.500
 test.

64
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.600
And that's what we see here. 72% are going

65
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600
 to falsely be accused.

66
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.400
of testing positive of being guilty when

67
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.000
 they are not

68
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.000
Now this is a this is

69
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.400
 not exactly Bayesian.

70
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.600
Not yet.

71
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.900
but

72
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.900
the Bayesian theorem allows us to

73
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.900
account for all of this information

74
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.000
in that formula that we looked at earlier.

75
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.800
So we do not neglect.

76
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.800
critical information
