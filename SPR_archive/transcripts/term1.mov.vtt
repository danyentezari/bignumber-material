00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.600
We now want to look at some key.

1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.500
terms

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.400
and notation that we

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
 have to be very clear about right from the start.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.300
These are terms that we will come across again

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.500
 that again and again

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.400
not just in this tutorial, but

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.200
In statistics and probability Theory altogether there

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
 are some things you need to know about.

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.100
The notation that is not apparent that is

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.200
 not explicit, especially when it comes to random variables

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.700
 and events.

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.200
There is some concept that is implied, but it

13
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.000
 is not actually expressed mathematically.

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.600
So you want to both pay attention?

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.100
to the terms

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.300
that we are going to talk about now and the notation.

17
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.400
you may even have to come back to this video at a

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.300
 later point just to

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.300
review

20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.900
while we were talking about now.

21
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.300
because it's

22
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.700
easy to forget

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.800
or confuse the terms because they are not intuitive.

24
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.300
But anyway, let's begin first.

25
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.500
with four words

26
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.100
outcome

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.200
event

28
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.500
sample space

29
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.000
and experiment

30
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.300
they would experiment is to perform an action.

31
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.800
That produces an outcome.

32
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.700
for example flipping a coin

33
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.200
When if the action of flipping a coin

34
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.900
 is an experiment?

35
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.300
The action of rolling a dice is an experiment.

36
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.500
Taking a picture of something is an experiment.

37
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.100
Pressing the light switch is an experiment.

38
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.000
now if you press the light switch

39
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.200
you can have two possible outcomes.

40
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.000
Either the light will be turned on.

41
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.100
Or the light will be turned off.

42
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.000
if you take a picture you have

43
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.100
infinitely many outcomes

44
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.900
It can be a picture of a cat.

45
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.200
It could be a picture of yourself.

46
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.000
You get the idea?

47
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.500
when you

48
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.300
flip a coin

49
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.200
when you perform this experiment the outcome could

50
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.100
 be either heads or tails.

51
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.500
Now it's also important to keep in mind that an

52
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.800
 outcome.

53
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.400
Can sometimes be numerical?

54
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.500
But sometimes it could be a picture or a

55
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.700
 word or a sound.

56
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.700
So we can have different and the word is modalities or

57
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.900
 different data types if you like.

58
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.100
Your performance experiment?

59
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.600
You get an outcome?

60
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500
Now suppose we perform five experiments.

61
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.000
And now you have five outcomes.

62
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.000
If you put these five outcomes into a set.

63
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.500
We call this an event.

64
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.400
So an event is a collection of outcomes.

65
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.700
Let's say now you perform seven.

66
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.400
More experiments so you get seven more outcomes.

67
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.600
Those seven outcomes will allow also be in a set

68
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.200
 which you call an event. So now you have two.

69
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.700
You have two sets you have two events.

70
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.400
Event one with five outcomes.

71
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.000
Event 2 with 7 outcomes if

72
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.100
 you put these two events together.

73
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.100
Or more generally speaking.

74
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.900
the collection of all of your events

75
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.500
is what we call the sample space.

76
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.200
I'm going to show you a picture now, but keep in mind.

77
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.700
The term sample space comes from probability

78
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.100
 Theory.

79
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.700
And do not want to create some association with the

80
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.300
 word sample in statistics.

81
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.500
These are two different fields.

82
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.100
And they use the word sample, but they use the word sample to

83
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.900
 mean to different things.

84
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.400
So here's a picture to describe what

85
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.200
 I just said visually.

86
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.500
So we said we have an experiment which is some action.

87
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.600
That produces an outcome.

88
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600
like flipping a coin

89
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.200
you flip the coin.

90
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.400
And you get a tails?

91
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200
You flip a coin you get a heads.

92
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.600
so in the event

93
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.600
We'll have multiple outcomes or I should say can have multiple

94
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.100
 outcomes.

95
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.100
in this figure, I'm only putting one outcome, but

96
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.300
An event can contain multiple outcomes.

97
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.600
And then you can perform more experiments.

98
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.100
Without comments that will go inside another event. So earlier I said

99
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.800
 you have one event with for example five outcomes.

100
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.700
You have another event with for example 7 outcomes if

101
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.400
 you put your events if you take all of your

102
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.800
 events.

103
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.200
However, many they are.

104
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.400
If you would all ever events into another set.

105
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.400
This one set that contains all of your events is

106
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.000
 what we call.

107
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.700
the sample space
