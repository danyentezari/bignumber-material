Let's do one more.

1
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.900
We have two exercises for pmf and CDF because these

2
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.600
 are quite important.

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.400
pmf and CDF exercise 2

4
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.700
and here's the question.

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.800
and you can just

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600
I don't have five but

7
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.800
it can do the first two.

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.300
So we will leave the the next three four

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.200
 you can do it on your own. I will

10
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.400
 share the link to this document this.

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
To this, you know web page and you can

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.900
 what kind of work on this on your own?

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.400
But it says this a mail order computer business has six telephone

14
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.200
 lines a company has six telephone lines.

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.600
Let X denote the number of lines in use at

16
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.300
 a specified time.

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.700
Okay. So for example in one experiment.

18
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.200
two telephone are

19
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.500
active

20
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.900
in another experiment six are

21
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.700
active

22
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.400
And suppose the pmf like the problem

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.000
 again. Remember pmf probability distribution same thing suppose. They're

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.000
 probably the distribution of the random variable X

25
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.800
 is given in this table.

26
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.500
So when the value is at 0

27
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.400
like what is the probability that?

28
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800
Zero lines will be used 10%

29
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.600
And the highest is 25% We have three lines.

30
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.700
that are

31
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.900
you know.

32
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.400
in use

33
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.100
so the exercise is for question one and two don't worry about

34
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.900
 three four and five.

35
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.800
I will leave the answer to the previous question here for

36
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.700
 your so you can compare.

37
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.900
And try to solve it.

38
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.400
So five minutes on this and we'll solve together. By the

39
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.500
 way, if you work if you're looking at the exercise and

40
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.200
you're not able to you don't know where to

41
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.500
 start.

42
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.200
Or if you if you're not certain about specific thing.

43
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.300
Put your question in the chat, even if this is your first time.

44
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.200
Put your questions in the chat.

45
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.100
in fact if you have any question about this

46
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.700
Topic altogether like statistics probability DNR

47
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.100
 put your quest in the chat.
