00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.200
Let's do the first one at so it says

1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.700
 calculate the probability of each of the following events the event

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.200
 where we have at most three lines in

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.700
 use.

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.600
Okay, what is the probability that at most three lines are

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.900
 in use so let's let's do this together now.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.100
I'm going to come to box map.

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.400
Let's begin with question one.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.200
question one

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.900
and let's think about what it's asking us to do.

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.800
This will be mathematical rotation.

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.400
So P of what P of?

12
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.600
P of x

13
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.700
less than or equal to 3 it says at most

14
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.200
 like the limit is 3

15
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.300
 at most 3, so we are going to accumulate the

16
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.500
 probability from 0 to 3.

17
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.400
So in other words we are we are saying what is the probability

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.300
 that X less than equal to 3?

19
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.500
Like count up like count up to the probability distribution

20
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.000
 of the random variable what it is at Value 3.

21
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.900
so

22
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.200
we're asking if x equals to 0.

23
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.400
or

24
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.000
or

25
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.400
x equals 1 or x equals 2

26
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.400
or x equals

27
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.400
3

28
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.200
yeah, so we also have to include the probability when no lines are in use

29
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.400
 because it it's asking us at most three

30
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.700
 lines.

31
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.200
It's not saying at least one and up at

32
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 most three. It's at most three so we have to add up all of the probability.

33
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.700
So that means we have to count.

34
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.000
the probability of 0

35
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.300
and 1 and 2 and

36
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.700
you know up to three.

37
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.200
one

38
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.800
plus two

39
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.200
plus three

40
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.000
plus 4

41
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900
y 4 that's a mistake. Sorry.

42
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.400
and so let's

43
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.700
plug in the numbers

44
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.100
so this is the number of

45
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.500
telephone lines that I use

46
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.600
so they have six telephone lines here. We

47
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.200
 ask you like for example here when we look at six we're asking

48
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.500
 what is the probability that all six all six

49
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.500
 will be in use

50
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.800
That's 4%

51
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.600
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I guess see that that's

52
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.800
 the thing with textbooks sometimes even

53
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.300
 the question.

54
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.200
Gets in the way of you figuring out the problem. You don't even know what

55
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.600
 the question is saying. I agree maybe this the the question could

56
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.300
 be phrased better. The question could be phrased. But

57
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.500
 yes, thank you Matt. Yeah X is the sum of the lines.

58
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.300
So is one line is used zero lines is used

59
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.200
 what one like one person's on the phone two people

60
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.800
 on the phone three people on the phone and so on.

61
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.000
And here the first question asked what is

62
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.700
 it? Probably that at most three people on the phone like four three employees are

63
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.600
 underlying talking to customers. For example.

64
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.100
And what we do to answer this question is we add up the

65
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.200
 numbers.

66
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.400
So we add up point 10 point 15 Point 20

67
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.000
 and point twenty five.

68
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.000
Point ten point fifteen Point twenty Point twenty five

69
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.800
so point 10

70
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.900
sorry point 10 point 15.

71
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.200
point

72
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.200
I'll come back to comment and

73
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.800
 there's a second Point ten point 15 Point 20 point.

74
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.200
25

75
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.900
and if you add this up, so that's 25 plus 40.

76
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.400
 So that's 0.65.

77
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.500
now Anders says

78
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400
Maybe it's clear if you don't use capital X in

79
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 the introduction to the variable.

80
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.000
In the introduction to the variable.

81
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.400
That I make a mistake 0.7.

82
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.100
Point seven, sorry.

83
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.100
And there's what did you mean by?

84
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.100
introduction to the variable

85
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.200
if you can clarify that question for me.

86
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.900
But let's see.

87
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.600
But I'm going to assume you're asking to

88
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.100
 use a different character to denote the random variable. But

89
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.100
 the thing is the convention in statistics is to use.

90
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.600
Yes, yes. Okay. So I'm I'm gonna answer Andrew's question

91
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.200
 by answering Dexter's question. Yes, there is a there's a difference

92
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.500
 between

93
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.300
capital x and a sample X

94
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.900
the entire table that you're looking at this entire thing.

95
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.500
Okay.

96
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.200
At least the first column.

97
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.700
random variable X

98
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.400
corresponds to the entire

99
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.400
I know I say Colin, but I guess here it's a roll.

100
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.500
Okay, but if you put it turn this around it'll be a column anyway.

101
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.500
the random Bible corresponds to all of these X

102
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.800
 values

103
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.400
okay X is this

104
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.100
I don't want to use the word set because set means something

105
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.400
 specific in mathematics, but it is the thing containing all of these small

106
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.200
 Nexus. So all of these small X's go into the BX.

107
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.200
The other problem with the word random variable is

108
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.100
 it's not a valuable because when we think about

109
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.000
 the variable we think about a small letter.

110
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.600
that is

111
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.900
as that has to assign a specific number.

112
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.000
You see the person who called.

113
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.800
This thing random variable was called mokorov Russian.

114
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.900
He's up.

115
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.400
person who made big contributions to the field of

116
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.300
 probability Theory

117
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.000
But by there by death of the mathematical definition is

118
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.900
 that it's really a function. It's really

119
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.100
 a function. It Maps a domain to

120
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.700
 a code domain. So for example, you would say

121
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.600
What is the seat for example

122
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.100
 you'll pass a seat number to the random variable and it will tell

123
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.400
 you whether it's it's a side or not a sign that's effectively a

124
00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.400
 function.

125
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.900
So when you look at when you hear about the random variable X and you

126
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.600
 see it in writing.

127
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.800
Try to identify it as a function not as a

128
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.500
 numeric not as a valuable that corresponds to

129
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:12.900
 a number.

130
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.200
Okay Dexter.

131
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.200
And I hope Anderson also answers your question as

132
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.300
 to why we use a big X. It's important.

133
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.100
It's a there's a reason why it's upper X.

134
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.500
now if in the text X has

135
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.100
 already been assigned that's when we move on to y and z

136
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.600
this is true also for

137
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.000
small X if small X has been assigned to a value and

138
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.400
 you have to choose another random value would go with YNC.

139
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.700
This is the convention mathematics. If you have constants, he used

140
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.200
 the first letters in the alphabet. So a b and c would be constants xyzing

141
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.500
 variables.

142
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:48.800
Okay.

143
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.400
let's quickly do the answer for question two, and

144
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.200
 then we move on to the next to the next topic which is

145
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.700
which is

146
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.000
the moment

147
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.600
and then we can we'll start to wrap up

148
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.700
 the wrap up this the moment by the way.

149
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.600
The moment is a pivotal.

150
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.200
point in our Learning Journey here

151
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.900
But let's quickly answer this question. So we really like understand the probability

152
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.300
 notation and the random variable notation the

153
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.500
 probability distribution notation.

154
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.400
so question to ask

155
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.800
question two

156
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:30.900
asks

157
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.000
At least three lines are in use. What does that mean at least three meaning three

158
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.900
 or more?

159
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:38.800
three or more

160
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.900
so I'm just going to borrow.

161
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.100
The solution here to complete the

162
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.800
 solution for this exercise.

163
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.700
This would be

164
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.100
probability that X

165
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.900
will be greater than or equal to 3.

166
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.100
Now in some text actually.

167
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.400
Always stick to less than equal sign. So the position

168
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.900
 of 3 and X would change but that's not important right now.

169
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.500
The idea is

170
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.400
What is the probability that three or more telephone lines will

171
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:14.400
 be?

172
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.600
active

173
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.200
so we probably have three.

174
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.900
probability of

175
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.500
the random value random variable when it is at

176
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.700
 three, that's such a mouthful.

177
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.200
But I'm trying to be precise with my words what to

178
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:31.200
 do.

179
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.900
and then P equals 4

180
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.400
If someone can quickly add up the numbers, I would appreciate

181
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.400
 it because I don't have the solution to this exercise. I'm solving it

182
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.700
 with you.

183
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:43.600
and

184
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.200
three four five or six

185
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.900
three four

186
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.200
three four

187
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.100
five or

188
00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.000
six

189
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.300
But you know that's you just have to add up the numbers. It's quite

190
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.300
 simple three four five or six. So three

191
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:06.600
 is

192
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.000
Point 25

193
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.600
and then

194
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.500
0.244

195
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.000
and

196
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.400
point

197
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.000
six four five

198
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.200
and point four

199
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.200
four six

200
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.900
Yeah, sorry.

201
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.500
45 plus 10

202
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.200
Okay. Yes. So for example you could

203
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.600
 use this.

204
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.800
We haven't even made it to.

205
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.600
The other topic since but just this.

206
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.700
The ideas that we've looked at so far namely probability the

207
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.400
 mass function and the cumulative distribution function.

208
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.300
would allow you to for example gain insight into your

209
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.300
let's say your business.

210
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.500
or any activity

211
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.800
That you're taking.

212
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.900
So for example, you can see that.

213
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.800
You're more likely to have.

214
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.600
or the probability of having

215
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.900
three lines or up to three lines is higher than

216
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.000
 having three or more lines.

217
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.500
And maybe you can use that to influence your business decision.

218
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.600
now it doesn't warrant us to

219
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.400
graph this probability distribution because

220
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.800
 it's such a small data set.

221
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.300
But nonetheless once we do get it get into bigger data

222
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:40.400
 sets.

223
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.600
It will be this the random variable in the probability distribution

224
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.100
 that will allow us to get to

225
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.900
You know graphs and charts and that kind of thing.
