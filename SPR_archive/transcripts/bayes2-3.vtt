00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.600
Okay, so this is that same table?

1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.200
but now

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.800
we have relative frequencies.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.100
How do we how do we get from this? How do we get

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.700
 to frequencies to relative frequencies? Well, if for

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.800
 example

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.200
A and B had five elements in common, we would divide 5 over

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.300
 100 and that would give us

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.400
well 0.05.

9
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.500
And then we do the same thing. We divide all of the marginal.

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.800
and relative frequencies

11
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.800
by 100 and that's how we get these.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.700
decimal numbers

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.100
Which is how we get to which is how

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.300
 we go from relative frequency to probability anyway.

15
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.000
now

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.800
remember that the

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.300
Remember the formula for the Bayesian theorem.

18
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.800
 I'm gonna actually copy it over here.

19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400
Now this is still this is still conditional probability.

20
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.700
But once we understand

21
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.100
the

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.900
terms

23
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.600
and how we would extract the values for these

24
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.200
 terms from the table.

25
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.200
Then we can talk about deriving the base theorem the

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.500
 formula for the Bayesian theorem.

27
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
so first, let's

28
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.200
write down the marginal probabilities. So

29
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.600
 these are the

30
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.800
the first two are the marginals

31
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.100
and the second two are

32
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.200
the joint

33
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600
We have marginal probabilities joint probability the

34
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.700
 probabilities and now we see how we get the conditional probabilities.

35
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400
So the joint probability of a well, we just look

36
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.100
 at the margins and that's this one over here.

37
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.100
the probability of B is 10

38
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.200
and if you want to do not A and B we get

39
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.700
35 or a and 94 B

40
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.000
and if you want to know what what their joint probability disorder will

41
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.400
 again, we can just look up the table.

42
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.300
So A and B. That's 5.

43
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.400
Again, they had five elements in common if we divide by 100 that

44
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.600
 gives us five or five percent.

45
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.300
Over here if you if you notice I'm using.

46
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.800
The letter c on top of B.

47
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.200
There are different ways to

48
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.300
Express the complement you can use till day

49
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.500
 next to the element or put excuse me

50
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.600
 till they next to the letter or I vertical

51
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600
 line above the letter or put a

52
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.800
 c.

53
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.200
at the top

54
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.700
So there are different ways to use the complement. I've actually done I've

55
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.100
 had to do this because when I use it

56
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.400
 till they character the spacing doesn't work out well, so

57
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.700
 I just

58
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.800
alternative we have used the letter c but they're

59
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.200
 the same thing.

60
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.100
This is a complement of B.

61
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.100
This is the complement of B.

62
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.300
I've only changed the notation because of the

63
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.800
 document formatting.

64
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.000
They are interchangeable. They are the same exact thing.

65
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.300
It's like multiplication you can use what you

66
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.500
 can use.

67
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.500
The X symbol from multiplication or you can put a dot

68
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.100
 or can put an asterisk or it can

69
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.800
 just put two letters next to each other and that's still multiplication.

70
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.200
Okay, but let's carry on.

71
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.300
Let's see how we can get to conditional probability. Well

72
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.900
 conditional probability says that

73
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.100
the probability of event a

74
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.200
occurring given event B

75
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.100
is given by

76
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.400
the intersection of those two events over

77
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.600
the hypothesis

78
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.100
Again, let me read this again. So we read this as

79
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.900
 the probability the probability of a given that vertical

80
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.700
 line is given given B.

81
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.200
And that's how we express it.

82
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.900
Why do we have the module probability B

83
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.500
 in the denominator?

84
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.100
Because when a certain event occurs, we're saying

85
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.000
 given event B.

86
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.900
the total number of possible outcomes

87
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.200
Is the total number of possible outcomes?

88
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.500
Of the event B.

89
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.000
so

90
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.400
here's another way to think about it, right?
