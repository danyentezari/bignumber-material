00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.500
All right. So let's look at some basic.

1
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.500
are

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.400
syntax

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.800
and they will look at some examples with plotting and

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.300
the good thing about our studio is

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.200
I obviously want to work with data sets.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.300
 So some data sets are already included so you don't have to actually go

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.100
 and create a sample Excel sheet to experiment.

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.800
a number of

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.000
built-in functions

10
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.900
in our studio

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.600
Where you don't have to like?

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.300
You can visualize you can visualize.

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.600
And work with these important.

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.000
Probability distribution functions. So for example then for

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.900
 discrete.

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
discreet RVs RV means

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.000
 random variable

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.900
You have popular.

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.300
probability distributions like

20
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.500
the binomial distribution

21
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.000
I'll show the function for that.

22
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.400
You have the Plus or the Bernoulli distribution?

23
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.000
Okay, this one has to do with trials.

24
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.600
if you remember I said

25
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.700
trials are special type of experiments. These are

26
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.900
experiments that have

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.700
only two possible outcomes like flipping

28
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.000
 a coin

29
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.400
There is it to work with and then you have something like the Apostle

30
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.800
 distribution.

31
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.000
He then have continuous random variables.

32
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800
And I told the most important of them all.

33
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.900
whether the discreet or otherwise

34
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.300
Is the normal distribution we'll look at some examples with

35
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.500
 this.

36
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.600
But then you also have other ones like the

37
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.900
 exponential distribution.

38
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.300
and for

39
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.100
with our studio

40
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.800
you also have

41
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.300
so these are the probability distributions you have different probability distribution

42
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.300
 functions to work with these different types of

43
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.700
 probability distributions.

44
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.000
And I'll show you some of the steps for that. There's so many examples of

45
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.600
 these online.

46
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.100
But we'll go through some of them together.

47
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.600
and the thing with the

48
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.900
the

49
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.900
so our study is great in that it's easy to work with it.

50
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.500
And you don't have to do calculations by

51
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.800
 hand. The problem is the

52
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.200
the wave they've done name their function is not really

53
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.600
 intuitive. So you you will find yourself.

54
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.200
You have to there's two ways. You can go about working to our

55
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.700
 studio either. You always have the documentation.

56
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.600
Website open I'll show you that now to

57
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.800
 you or you should find some boilerplate script.

58
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.700
and

59
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.200
refer to that bully boilerplate script every time you want to do

60
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.700
 your statistical study.

61
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.600
continuous RVs in the published equations

62
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.400
all three

63
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.300
I mean all all random variables and it

64
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.500
 probably should distributions will have

65
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.700
the three types of functions I told you about or two they will

66
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.800
 have a

67
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.100
a pmf a pmf and

68
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.800
see the f

69
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.900
if they are discrete.

70
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.200
and if they are continuous they will have

71
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.200
PDF and CDF. So CDF is for both.

72
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.300
Okay.

73
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.200
so

74
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.300
Now, let me take you to documentation website.

75
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.500
So it's this is the website you want to look at and I would

76
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.900
 suggest if you're learning our studio use this

77
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.400
 website as opposed to.

78
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.500
Going on different blocks.

79
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.100
because the thing with blogs is that it's

80
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.400
a some of them don't use the best.

81
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.400
You know.

82
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.400
functions to do the

83
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.700
 study and

84
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.300
and somebody do a better job.

85
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.300
It's a hit and miss kind of situation the so and

86
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.700
 I really like the way the document their code. So for example

87
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.700
for the normal distribution

88
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.100
for the normal distribution

89
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.400
Probability distribution the normal distribution is kind of probably distribution. There

90
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.800
 are four kinds of probability distribution

91
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.200
 functions.

92
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.800
This is by the way, please put I want

93
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.500
 you to look here. This is why this is why at

94
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.500
 the beginning I told you I'm very

95
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.800
keen on using precise terms. Yeah, and

96
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.900
 I keep going on and on.

97
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.800
with acronyms and their correct

98
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.500
Names, look how our studio just

99
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.100
 calls the debt probably density function density.

100
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.300
They don't say that they don't say probably density function.

101
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.600
The desert density then you have distribution function which distribution

102
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.200
 function the probability that mass function

103
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.200
 or the probability or the cumulative

104
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.400
 distribution function. This is why I meant this is what I what I

105
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400
 met when I say it can be confusing.

106
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.200
There are two types there is cmf.

107
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.600
A CDF and pmf and if

108
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.000
 we don't like spill out the name completely.

109
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.300
The person on the other end doesn't know to which you're referring and this can

110
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.900
 be confusing not to mention.

111
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.000
That the names have given their functions is not really like I

112
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.500
 said intuitive.

113
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.100
So you have you will find yourself coming back and forth.

114
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.100
to these

115
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.800
examples and these are standard these are like the

116
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.200
these are Snippets that are used all the time.

117
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.900
Imagine after having to work with the more novel.

118
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.200
function

119
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.800
function so they have they have the PDF.

120
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.400
They have the pmf.

121
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.400
and the cmf
