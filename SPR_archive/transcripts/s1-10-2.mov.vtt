00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's come back to the formula.

1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.400
to calculate the first mean

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.900
Excuse me to calculate the first moment.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.400
To calculate the first moment of the population.

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.600
in other words the mean the population mean

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.500
you are going to calculate the first moment. So the population

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.600
 mean how do you get it by calculating the first moment these they're the

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.700
 same thing.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.100
And that means you take the sum.

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.500
e to the power

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.500
T times x sub 1 times the probability

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.200
let me quickly tell you why we have

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.600
 e

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.000
okay.

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.100
for the four moments

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.400
standard deviation kurtosis

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.000
skewness

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.800
and mean we are going to use a sample listen

18
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.500
 to this keyword to estimate.

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.700
parameters of the population

20
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.800
moments of the population

21
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.200
in mathematics

22
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.100
There are four levels of estimation. There are four

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.800
 ways. You can estimate.

24
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.300
Number one is using guesstimate.

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.100
Just doing numbers in your head.

26
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.500
Then you have Lee polynomials.

27
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.500
Linear polynomial for example, is this second best way to guess a

28
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.600
 number?

29
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.100
The fourth level is using something called McLaren series.

30
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.600
The formula for calculating moments whether it

31
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.300
 is a discrete random variable or a continuous random variable.

32
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.300
The best way to do an estimation is to do McLaren series.

33
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.900
 Okay, so I'm just putting this out. So, you know

34
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.300
that the letter e this this one

35
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.800
 single character is talking.

36
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.500
is this

37
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.600
can be computed this way ease, of course Euler's

38
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.600
 number.

39
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.300
which is an irrational number but

40
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.600
Another way you can compute all is never is.

41
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.000
Usually my clouds use which is a type of Taylor series.
