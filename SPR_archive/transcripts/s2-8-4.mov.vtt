00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
so

1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.000
I am going to now take.

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.000
this formula

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.400
and

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.800
plotted it put it inside.

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.200
Wolfram Alpha

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.900
because I want to refer to two things you see here.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.000
If I go into if I go back to the exercise.

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.700
It says in order for you to solve this problem.

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.700
In order for you to know.

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.400
if the

11
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.700
random variable the standard the standardized normal variable

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 this Z

13
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.500
variable

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.200
will fall into

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.400
that range where you have 2.9.31. You would

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.700
 have to use the lookup table for the Z score.

17
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.300
It looks like this you may have you will see

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.300
 this in different textbooks.

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.500
Okay, I'm going to show you.

20
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.000
How what I will show you how one of these values is.

21
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.200
Like how you calculate one of these values and why you

22
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.700
 would use a table instead of trying to calculate yourself?

23
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.500
Okay.

24
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.200
So let me go back to yes

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800
 this formula.

26
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.100
And here's how it works.

27
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.500
I'm going to copy.

28
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.600
this code

29
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.400
let's bring it into word from Alpha.

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.400
Okay.

31
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.300
And let me come back to the previous exercise for a

32
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 moment.

33
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.200
and there will be complete this what I want to talk about is how

34
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.300
the five function

35
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.500
took

36
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.300
the standard deviation of 1

37
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.300
and arrived at this value how I took

38
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.900
 the standard deviation of minus 1 or after this value?

39
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.100
So we take the difference and determine the probability.

40
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.500
Okay.

41
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.800
the probability that

42
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.500
the experiments of a random variable a standardized

43
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.700
 random variable will fall.

44
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.800
between

45
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.300
One standard deviation left one standard deviation that write

46
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.800
 that whole story is 0.6. And I want to show you how you calculate this

47
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.100
 number. If you know how to calculate step even though it's

48
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.000
in the table

49
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.400
Well, then you would know how to calculate.

50
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.200
Or for example again. Let me

51
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.100
 remind you. This is leading we are going to

52
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.900
What we're trying to do is understand everything we need.

53
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.500
So we can do.

54
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.200
hypothesis testing regression analysis and

55
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.900
 then determine

56
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.400
if

57
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.400
we are doing our statistical study correctly

58
00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.800
 or not.

59
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.600
So we have to understand what every single character.

60
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.800
What every single function means?

61
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.400
before we can

62
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.800
recognize

63
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.400
How accurate we are inaccurate we are with our statistical

64
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.600
 study.
