00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.200
Let's go back to slide so I can make a quick comment.

1
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay.

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.200
the issue with the issue with

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.700
e to the power x

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.900
is that when you derive it?

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.000
You get e to the power x again?

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.700
now when we take the derivative of you e to

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.500
 the power x we're not trying to

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.500
derive e to the power of X that

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.300
term specifically rather we are

10
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.400
 trying to derive.

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.800
the thing

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.500
to which your VX is equivalent?

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.400
That is the McLaren series.

14
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.700
Okay, so we use e to the power x

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.200
to represent the McLaren Series so we don't have to write down

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.500
 the whole.

17
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.100
Series every time we want to talk about it. We just

18
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.000
 use it's about X, but the problem is when you

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.800
take its derivative.

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.100
You can eat the power x so in a way the T.

21
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.000
in a way that t

22
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.500
is going to help us express.

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.300
the series The Way We want to

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.600
and then

25
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.800
Evaluate the terms within that series accordingly.

26
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.900
So T is really nothing more than are helping variable. It's

27
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.000
 just facilitates.

28
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400
deriving

29
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.000
the terms of that sequence

30
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.900
determine that series and we will look at that in a second.

31
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
So what happens when you raise or what happens when you take

32
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.700
 the derivative of e to the power x?

33
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.200
Times t e raise the power exam see what happens.

34
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.000
 Is that by the power rule?

35
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300
The second variable has to come down.

36
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.000
And he gets to keep its powers.

37
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.200
So we you take the derivative of e to

38
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.400
 the power x times T. You can x times e to

39
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.200
 the power T times x

40
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.200
and that's what we want.

41
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.000
That's what we want. This is going to help us evaluate the moments.

42
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.700
of the random variable

43
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.000
So that's that's the only reason we have tea in there.

44
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.800
It's the same reason why algebra, for example, you would use parentheses.

45
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.200
In an expression why you would sometimes

46
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.100
 move numbers around?

47
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900
or factor them

48
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200
you're not changing the quantity. You're not changing

49
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.900
 the value.

50
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.700
of the

51
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.500
expressions of the equation you just expressing when

52
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.000
 a different way so you can solve

53
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.600
so I can solve the equation solve for x that's what algebra is

54
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600
 about. And this is what we do and we do the same thing here.

55
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.300
So that's it. That's what he is. It's a helper valuable. It's

56
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.800
 a variable to help you with your mathematical rotation.

57
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.400
Okay, so now let's go back to these. Let's go

58
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400
 back to the reader now.

59
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.900
now if we did not have

60
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.200
t

61
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.800
as an extra variable.

62
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.300
In the power of E.

63
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.700
Then we will not be able to.

64
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.800
Derive the terms in this sequence any further because

65
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.200
 we know we know what happens when you have it raised the

66
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.900
 power x you derive it you get EU to the power x again.

67
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.400
And this is where you see T help us.

68
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.700
 In fact, that's why it's sometimes referred to as the

69
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.400
 help of a variable.

70
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.100
Okay, so now let's take

71
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.300
what we have now understood about

72
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.200
You know.

73
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.100
e to the power x times t

74
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.900
populate those values populate the the values

75
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.800
 for T and X.

76
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.400
to see what

77
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.900
you know the sequence evaluates to

78
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.000
okay, so we have the moment generally function which is equal to

79
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.400
 this.

80
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.600
Well sequence.

81
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.200
and then when we take and then of course when we

82
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.900
right out the sequence.

83
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.000
And then we take the derivative.

84
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.700
of each

85
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.800
term within the sequence as you can see here.

86
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.200
If e raised to the power x sub y sub T

87
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.200
 then we take when we take the derivative of the first.

88
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.200
Term, okay.

89
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.700
By the power rule x sub I comes down.

90
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.100
Here is x sub 1 x sub 1 comes down.

91
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.700
and of course

92
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.500
he gets to keep its powers and then multiplied by

93
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.000
 its probability.

94
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.900
Then X up two comes down.

95
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.100
then x sub 3 comes down all on

96
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.800
 and on until we have

97
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.000
You know all of the all of the X's.

98
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.500
multiplied with a corresponding probability

99
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.300
so plugging in the numbers we get, you know zero time.

100
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.000
the first random the first

101
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800
value in the random value is zero. It's probably 0.1.

102
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.600
 Okay, let's look at the table very quickly.

103
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.800
0 has probabilities 0.1.

104
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.200
1 has probably 0.2. So if you

105
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.600
 scroll back down.

106
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.900
If you scroll back down.

107
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.200
If you scroll back down there you have it.

108
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.900
multiply the multiply the

109
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.400
so multiply the X the small x

110
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400
 with this probability distribution.

111
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.100
And you keep going and now and on and on I'll tell you all of

112
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.700
 the axis and they're probably distributions.

113
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.900
And that's how you get.

114
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.000
the first moment

115
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.800
the expected value

116
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.600
Okay.

117
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.400
Knowing this it will make it easy for you to find the

118
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.400
 remaining moments moment. 2 1 3 1.4. Let's quickly

119
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.700
 look at those.

120
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.600
So to calculate the second moment.

121
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.600
Calculating the second moment is the variance and

122
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.600
 of course once you have the values you can get the standard deviation for

123
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.400
 the random variable.

124
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.200
So what you do?

125
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.200
The variance is indicated as Sigma squared

126
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.200
 standard deviation as Sigma. If you take

127
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.300
 the square root of if you take the square root of the

128
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.600
 variance, it gets standard deviation. But anyway.

129
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.300
That is to say that you are taking the expected value.

130
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.800
for the

131
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.200
second moment

132
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.900
So the calculate that to calculate the variance.

133
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.500
You take the expected value of x

134
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:18.900
 minus.

135
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.500
it's mean

136
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.400
r squared

137
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.100
so two things to talk about here. First of all,

138
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.700
 how do we arrive at the mean?

139
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.200
Because we calculate the force moment, but calculating the

140
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.100
 first moment now, why do we Square it now? The reason

141
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.300
 we Square the variance?

142
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.600
is because we want to

143
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.600
deal with negative numbers

144
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.800
if you have a positive number and a negative number potentially

145
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800
 can cancel them out.

146
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.500
by squaring negative numbers

147
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.600
All of the numbers become positive if they're negative, they're positive

148
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.200
 and they're positive they remain positive.

149
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400
Then we add them all up.

150
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.900
And we get the variance.

151
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.600
So we will.

152
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.300
Square it to deal with the minuses. So all

153
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.100
 the numbers are positive and it would score and then

154
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.200
 we take the square root to bring it to make it proportional again.

155
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.300
And that's what this is talking about. Is that is what this this line

156
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:22.900
 is talking about.

157
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.500
and of course

158
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.400
if you look at this document, you will see that it's

159
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.100
almost self-explanatory

160
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.600
now the third moment.

161
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.000
has to do with skewness, so we wanted to be

162
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:42.700
centered

163
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.100
or if you want to be compared to the mean average we wanted

164
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.200
 to be relative to zero, okay?

165
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.400
so we need

166
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.400
we need we need to take into

167
00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:58.900
 consideration.

168
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.200
the signs

169
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.000
of the integers that we adding up so minus is a pluses.

170
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.100
matter

171
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:16.900
now

172
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.500
when we get this skewness.

173
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.000
we want to

174
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.800
we want to have a

175
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.400
we we want to measurement to be independent of

176
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.700
 any particular measuring unit. So inches centimeters, what

177
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.800
 have you so we divided by Sigma cubed.

178
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.200
now similarly for the

179
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.000
 kurtosis

180
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.800
we have the same.

181
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.500
term

182
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.200
x minus mu raised to

183
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.700
 the power of 4 all divided by.

184
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.800
Sigma raised to the power 4

185
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.200
and this will give us the kurtosis.

186
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.200
now

187
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.300
for

188
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:09.700
this

189
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.200
now for this time

190
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.800
knowing this much about the moments is sufficient. If

191
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.700
 you want to get into further detail about you know,

192
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.500
 why we raise the power 4 and looking at

193
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.700
 proofs and we can leave that for another time.

194
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.000
But it's for for now. This is

195
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.300
 sufficient. Okay, especially the first and second moments.

196
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.900
Knowing them in more detail.

197
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.900
Will be more helpful for us.

198
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.200
because first of all, we understand the concept

199
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:50.600
of

200
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.200
the moment and calculate the moment and it will

201
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.100
 help us appreciate.

202
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.000
You know the formula for the second third

203
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.800
 and fourth moments.

204
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.400
Now, of course, we'll be dealing with moments.

205
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.300
for

206
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.700
Our statistical studies in R. Now

207
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.400
 we want compute these.

208
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.000
Like we will not have to actually calculate them using.

209
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.500
Sequences and moment generating functions

210
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.000
 and R because these formulas are

211
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.100
 built into our studio.

212
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.500
So we can quickly evaluate the value by invoking a

213
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:30.600
 function.

214
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:31.800
and

215
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.300
and that's all there is to it.

216
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:37.700
Okay.

217
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.600
So you can refer to this document.

218
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.700
If you want to you know understand.

219
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.400
a moments and moment generating functions
