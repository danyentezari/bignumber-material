00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.600
So if I scroll up here?

1
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.900
Okay, this table represents the random

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.000
 variable and it's probably distribution.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.100
Okay.

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.200
the small X

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.800
represents

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.200
the outcomes

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.700
in the random variable

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.000
the values that the random value can take

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.400
And the probability distribution as you know is a probability that X will

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.500
 be equal to that certain.

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.100
value

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.500
Okay.

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.000
If you were to plot.

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.800
this

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200
random variable

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200
on the x-axis and it's probably

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.300
 distribution of the y-axis.

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.300
And you would you know, you would get that.

19
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.600
You would get the bar graph.

20
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.900
there are

21
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.600
ways to describe the bar graph for example

22
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.100
How sharp is its peak?

23
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.600
That's what we call kurtosis.

24
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.800
or other definition is how much it deviates from the normal distribution a

25
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.900
 normal distribution is a very

26
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.200
Recurring probability distribution like we don't we

27
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.900
 are talking about probably distributions, right? But certain probability distributions

28
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.200
 always a manifest himself. Like they always keep showing

29
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.100
 up in different.

30
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.700
places in the whole universe

31
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
For example that famous bell curve has everyone knows that bell

32
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 curve, right and bell curve is observed in different

33
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.200
 situations where the averages like

34
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.400
 the on average like the average

35
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.800
 is kind of concentrated in the middle and you have this Peak at the

36
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.600
 center and they kind of tailor off towards

37
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.900
 the end that's called the normal distribution so kurtosis.

38
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.300
Is a measure of how much you owe deviating from

39
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 the noble distribution is are you more flat or you're more

40
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.600
 Sharp?

41
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.500
That's something we want to know when we're looking at a property distribution. Then you

42
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 have something called skewness.

43
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.400
Let's say you lay out your data points.

44
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.000
But then you notice.

45
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.700
that the majority of the data points

46
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.400
do not have high probability, but then

47
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.300
 you get you towards the end. You have high probability.

48
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.000
Think of think about that analogy I give

49
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.500
 you with the disposable income.

50
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.900
Okay, if you plot out all the X values.

51
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.700
And those X values correspond to for example to members of

52
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.200
 the population.

53
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.800
Okay, and let's say you're trying to look at the probability distribution

54
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.500
 of

55
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.300
or let's say you're looking at a problem where?

56
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.500
the random variable the values in the random variable

57
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.400
 correspond to the number of

58
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.700
let's say people who buy

59
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.300
 Super yachts.

60
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.100
You know, what? I see Superior is these are X these are Yachts, but

61
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.300
 they're

62
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.100
incredibly big.

63
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.700
several dozens of people can fit into the yard

64
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.300
If we put the plot the random variable, you would

65
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.100
 probably simply see something skewed towards.

66
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.300
let's say

67
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.300
the members of that sample who have hire disposable account

68
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.100
that skewness.

69
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.400
then we have

70
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.800
variance

71
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.800
from which the standard deviation is derived, by the way.

72
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.800
Standard deviation is a square root of variance. We'll talk

73
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.400
 we'll get there later.

74
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.300
But variance will tell you how much there is

75
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.300
 variation from the mean.

76
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.500
of the probability distribution

77
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.500
And then we have expected now expected values an

78
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.900
 important term.

79
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.100
We all know what the mean is, right?

80
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.800
You add up the add up the data points together and

81
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.100
 divide them by their sum.

82
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.300
You get to me.

83
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.500
but when you're talking about the mean of the random variable

84
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.100
 specifically we call that the expected value my point is

85
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.400
 this

86
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.600
all of these terms that I've talked about

87
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.300
their individually called moments.

88
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.500
Let's get into the mathematic. Let's get into the notation. So

89
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.300
 we understand this in great detail, but my point is if you understand

90
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.900
 moments.

91
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.800
You'll be able to understand the different facets of

92
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.500
 distribution. And that means you'll be able to understand the

93
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.700
 different properties of a graph.

94
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.300
Okay.

95
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.700
So let's use this visual representation.

96
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.300
to understand what the mathematics is about

97
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.600
 the mathematical syntax about

98
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.600
very quickly the first moment.

99
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.600
By the way, the word moment has nothing to do with time again. If

100
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.100
 you're new to this terminology, this is what I want you to

101
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.100
 start this to remember to disassociate the word

102
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.600
 moment what the concept of time?

103
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.400
now the

104
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.300
Is borrowed from physics?

105
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.600
but if you're not familiar with

106
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.500
the concept in physics

107
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.600
or statistics and probably Theory then it has

108
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.400
 nothing to do with time.

109
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.100
It's just a concept now the last the first moment.

110
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.200
Of a probability distribution or the first moment of

111
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.100
 a random variable.

112
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.900
is the mean

113
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.100
It's Center.

114
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.400
Okay, we have different ways to measure the center. We have mean median mode, but for

115
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.600
 the most part mean is the most important.

116
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.500
characteristic of the center

117
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.200
The second moment.

118
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.500
Is the standard deviation some will tell these devariance but

119
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.100
 the way you get the standard vision is that the way you get to

120
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.600
 standard deviation is by calculating the variance?

121
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.500
Both of them are the second moment.

122
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.500
Third moment is the skewness as you can see.

123
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.000
Is it skewed to the left or to the right?

124
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.400
And of course fourth moment is the ketosis which I told you is how sharply it's

125
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.100
 it's the peak of the curve is

126
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.500
 and that tells you how much data has been concentrated.

127
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.400
Notice here we have.

128
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.200
a population mean

129
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.700
uses the Greek letter mu that's how you pronounce it and I I've

130
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.800
 typed in the pronunciation of it.

131
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.300
sample mean uses X it's bar X

132
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.500
 but it's still a

133
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.200
English letter

134
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.600
population standard deviation uses Sigma a Greek

135
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.400
 letter sample standard deviation uses s in

136
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.800
 English there remember this

137
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.500
Wouldn't we get into the formulas? If you see an English letter,

138
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.400
 you know you talk about the sample the smaller one if you

139
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.800
 see a Greek level you talk about the big picture population, okay?
