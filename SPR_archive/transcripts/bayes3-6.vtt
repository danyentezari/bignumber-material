00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.500
All right. So again, that's the

1
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.100
likelihood version of Base theorem

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.900
To find out the posterior.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.900
We multiply the likelihood.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.700
by the odds

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.400
well, if we found out that the likelihood is

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.700
 19.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.500
19 times in favor of being

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.300
detected positive

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.500
so we put 19 here.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.300
And we found out that the odds is 1 over 49.

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.200
And algebraically if we have this is

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 also another way we could rewrite this is

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.000
 19 over 1.

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.600
19 over 1

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.400
so we can just multiply straight across so 19 times 1

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400
 gives us 19.

17
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.100
And then we just get 49 in the denominator.

18
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.500
Evaluate this expression.

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.400
That's our posterior odds.

20
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.800
This is still.

21
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.400
likelihood

22
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.300
if you remember we said that if you want to go from odds

23
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.300
to probability

24
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.200
we must also put we have to put

25
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.800
 all of our events in the denominator.

26
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.300
So what was 49 again?

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.900
 Let's pull up the diagram.

28
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.500
Remember this is still about positive tests.

29
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.900
49

30
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.000
athletes

31
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.200
are not doping they tested positive, but they

32
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.600
 are not doping.

33
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.400
19 did 19 are guilty

34
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 of topic they tested positive and

35
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.800
 they're actually doping. So in order for us to come to turn

36
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.600
 this likelihood.

37
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.500
Into probability we must also bring the numerator

38
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.300
 which is an event.

39
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.100
into the denominator

40
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.100
So we have 1949 plus 19.

41
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.200
Which gives us 19 plus 19 over

42
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.700
 68, which once again evaluates to 28%

43
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.900
Okay, so

44
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.800
This is how this is one angle to

45
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.100
 look at the part the Bayesian theorem.

46
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.900
You would first gather your data.

47
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.700
You could also put it into a frequency frequency table

48
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.400
 with a modules on the side like we saw earlier.

49
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.400
And then you can plug in the data.

50
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.800
for the events

51
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.900
and you will get

52
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.400
your posterior

53
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.200
probability

54
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.200
and this is the this is this is the

55
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200
 derivation of it.

56
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.400
Now what I want to next talk about specifically why

57
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.300
 we multiply

58
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.700
the likelihood with the odds

59
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.100
and that's what's

60
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.400
and that's what we're going to talk about next.
