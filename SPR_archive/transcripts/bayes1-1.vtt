00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.400
in this section, we are going to look at

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.700
the

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.500
mathematical way

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.200
Of using the Bayesian theorem.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.800
specifically the algebraic way

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.600
of using the different terms.

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.000
In the Bayesian theorem, which is

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 an extension of conditional probability.

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.800
and then

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.700
the intuition

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.400
so as opposed to Simply plugging in numbers.

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.600
We want to understand why the terms

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.400
 are arranged the way they are

13
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.600
 arranged.

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.700
The first thing we'll do is look at

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.200
deriving the business theorem. So we will go

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.400
 from conditional probability to the Bayesian

17
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.700
 theorem.

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.900
And then once we have you know.

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.000
Done this algebraically we understand how and

20
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.900
 why we have this particular expression.

21
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.800
We will then turn.

22
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.300
to an example

23
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.000
as specifically we want to talk about

24
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.800
three key terms

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.300
in

26
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.300
Bayesian probability

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.800
and these three terms are the prior.

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.100
likelihood

29
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.300
and the posterior

30
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.200
now the way these two equations differ.

31
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.200
Is in the denominator?

32
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.500
at the right side of the equal sign so in this

33
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.200
Form we have the sum.

34
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.600
of the joint probabilities

35
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.600
In the second one, we have simply the

36
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.000
 marginal probability in the denominator.

37
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.800
You don't have to know the meaning of these words just yet.

38
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.800
Because that's what we're going to cover next. We're going to go over

39
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.900
 a number of terms with first go over.

40
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.200
Probability which you already know what that is,

41
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.300
 but we'll review it anyway.

42
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.100
Then we'll talk about marginal and Joint probabilities

43
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.000
 and once we've established these.

44
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.000
We can go back.

45
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.500
derive

46
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.200
the busy in theorem to formula for

47
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.300
 the Bayesian theorem

48
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.800
and then continue on to talk about terms that

49
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.600
 apply specifically in the

50
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.400
 Bayesian context.

51
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.900
so the words like

52
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.900
prior

53
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.500
likelihood and posterior

54
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.500
now, of course before we can talk about prior and likelihood

55
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.300
the product of which will give us the posterior.

56
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.600
We will also first talk about odds, which

57
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.100
 is the ratio of two.

58
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.700
marginal or joint probabilities

59
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.400
so again a lot of terminology, but

60
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.500
we are about to now Define these terms.
