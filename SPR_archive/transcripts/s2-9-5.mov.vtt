00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.300
And now let's go back here. So let's review the answer.

1
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.700
So we already said that for the first machine we able

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.400
 to express it this way. We would say x sub 1 has a mean

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.500
 of three standard deviation 3.1. Second machine has slightly higher

4
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.400
 mean average but lower standard deviation.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.700
and these are

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.900
this is where we want the experiments to fall between

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.800
so let's continue.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.200
We then plug in the numbers, right? So this used

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.600
 to be a

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.300
this and of

11
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.000
 course, this is the mean standard deviation. This is B.

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.000
Standard deviation means that deviation if

13
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.100
 plot in those numbers into the what

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.600
 do you call it?

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.500
the five function

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.700
so

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.100
Let's see what these numbers out of two before because I want

18
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.600
 to show you these Z table first.

19
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.800
So this gives us five of one.

20
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.700
Anyway, this this becomes 5 of 1.

21
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.100
And this becomes Phi of

22
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.400
 negative 1.

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.800
So when you when you like evaluate this

24
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.300
this fraction you get

25
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.800
One this one gives you minus one

26
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.600
 if we look up the z-score the

27
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.200
 Z table for the z-score table.

28
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.400
You will see that the you will find these.

29
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.700
Probabilities in that table. So let's go

30
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.800
 that table. Here's the link. We'll click here.

31
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.800
you get

32
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.600
0.158

33
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.600
66 that's what we have here.

34
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.000
And then for positive 1

35
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.800
where is positive 1?

36
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.400
positive 1 you get

37
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.900
Yeah, there we go.

38
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.200
0.84

39
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.100
134

40
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.500
so you see even though those machines had

41
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.300
 their own mean and their own standard deviation and you will come

42
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.000
 across different.

43
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.900
A problems where you know you'll have a normally distributed random

44
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.800
 variable continuous random variable.

45
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.400
It doesn't matter what the me, I mean.

46
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.500
even if you have different mean and different standard deviation once you normalize

47
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.600
 it

48
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.100
Once you normalize it using the techniques we've looked at

49
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.200
 now.

50
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.500
then

51
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.300
it's it becomes easy to then calculate calculate the

52
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.800
 probability. In fact, the only way you can calculate the probability.

53
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.800
The only way you can determine whether it's between 0 or 1.

54
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.700
Is for you to take that random variable transform a

55
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.600
 shift its me to zero.

56
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.700
Look up the Z score and then you will get the probability. So anyway.

57
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.100
We calculate the area.

58
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.100
for

59
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.100
standard deviation to the negative because that's what

60
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.900
 this adds up to this evaluates into.

61
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.100
and the

62
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.400
area for

63
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.800
Excuse me, the area for positive one of minus 1.

64
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.800
this is the probability for

65
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.400
positive 1 this is probably from minus 1 you subtract

66
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.400
 them because your point six eight two six. So this

67
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.600
 means

68
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.800
that the probability

69
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.100
that this machine the first machine, this is

70
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.900
 z sub 1 by the way.

71
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.100
The first machine will produce quarks.

72
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.200
That would be their 2.9 or 3 2.9 or

73
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.900
 three or three point one or somewhere between that small.

74
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.000
Acceptable range is 0.6826.

75
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.500
It's like 68% chance 68% probability.

76
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.500
That you would get the correct size.

77
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.500
Now is that acceptable?

78
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.300
When we're looking at the notation alone.

79
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.900
When we were looking at the notation alone.

80
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.900
You know, we could have been fooled by this.

81
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.200
the fact that this is right, you know,

82
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.800
 it's like

83
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.200
like it's directly three. It's what I just want us towards the

84
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.600
 upper end.

85
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.200
And we could have thought you know what maybe this has a better mean maybe

86
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.100
 this could be this could be good. But then when we

87
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.100
 take into account the standard deviation

88
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.600
We determine that has a 68%

89
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.400
68% probability

90
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.200
that it's coax will be at the right size.

91
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.000
Okay.

92
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.000
Let's compare it against the other one.

93
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.900
So we do the same thing.

94
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.400
This is z sub 2 by the way, even if you don't see the subscript it

95
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.100
 is the sub two.

96
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.300
So we take x x sub 2 we standardize it

97
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.200
 we shifted some into the zero.

98
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.600
and then we want to see if it falls between 3.1 or

99
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.700
2.9

100
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.200
Of course. We also have to standardize these numbers.

101
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.200
So we can evaluate.

102
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.000
There's a score so we do the same

103
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.600
 thing where we subtract the numerator from the mean divide all

104
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.900
 divided by the standard deviation.

105
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.100
And then of course we use the five function to measure.

106
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.200
the

107
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.700
cumulative probability

108
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.400
to measure the cumulative probability using the integration technique

109
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.800
 I told you about

110
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.200
this adds up to three.

111
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.800
If we look up the z-score.

112
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.300
If you look up the z-score for three.

113
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.200
this comes back to that the rule I told

114
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.600
 you earlier about 68 95 99.7 rule,

115
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.900
 so

116
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.300
Once down to deviation you get 68 probably 0.68

117
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.300
 probability two standard deviations.

118
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.400
 You have much higher probability. Now you're at 95.

119
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.400
Three standard deviations of a probability distribution

120
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.300
 you have 99.7 probability so highly highly

121
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.800
 highly likely that those experiments will occur.

122
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.900
So if we go down this table and look for three.

123
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.700
It's actually goes up to 3.9.

124
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.000
But at 3, it's 99.

125
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.400
It's a 0.998675 very high.

126
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.500
Okay.

127
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.300
and then

128
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.100
we plot that we put that number down.

129
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.300
On the negative side on the negative side.

130
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.100
This goes actually up to

131
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.200
like

132
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.300
this fraction evaluated to

133
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.700
 negative 7.

134
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.300
Evalu to negative 7. So that's

135
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.900
minus 7

136
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.100
standard deviations away

137
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.100
now

138
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.700
once you move past minus 3 standard deviation

139
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.200
 the part of positive side, there are three standard deviations the negative

140
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.400
 side. The probability is almost it's almost

141
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.200
 one. So this is negative seven and if I take it back to

142
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.900
 the z-score table

143
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.800
one doesn't go past minus 3.9 but you

144
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.200
 can see when it's at 3.9 is 0.005 and

145
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.700
 as you

146
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.300
Add to this like as you go towards

147
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.500
 the left.

148
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.600
Of the third standard deviation. The number

149
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.900
 gets smaller and smaller and smaller and like

150
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.300
and smaller

151
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.800
So that is why I have rounded like I've rounded

152
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.500
 this up to 0.0.0.01 or one

153
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.100
 it's actually even smaller than this.

154
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.900
So if we subtract

155
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.500
the probability

156
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.400
from the positive side

157
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.000
subtracted from the negative side. We actually get a big.

158
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.500
We get a lot of coverage. In fact, it's 99.8.79.9987.

159
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.600
So the probability that the second machine would produce quarks.

160
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.500
That have diameter between 3.9.

161
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.000
And 2.9 and 3.1 and 2.9 is

162
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.500
 9 9 8 7.

163
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.300
almost 1

164
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200
Almost 100%

165
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.100
Almost 100% of the corks produced by the second

166
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.200
 machine will fall in the correct range.

167
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.400
the other one

168
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.700
68.6826

169
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.200
much lower

170
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.800
much more susceptible to

171
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.500
you know.

172
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.600
producing failed quarks corks that are not usable

173
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:50.800
so I mean

174
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.800
that's like 0.3 or 30% probability

175
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.100
 that you produce a coconut use it so that's

176
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.600
Imagine that we were talking about something besides quarks.

177
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.000
How much waste how much?

178
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.600
Would that cost you a great deal?

179
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.400
well

180
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.200
using the techniques that we've looked at we were able to determine that. In

181
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.300
 fact, the second machine is much better.

182
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.100
and the first machine
