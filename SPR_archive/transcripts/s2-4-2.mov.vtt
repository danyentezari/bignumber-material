00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.500
Let's Go full screen

1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.700
so let's go over to the normal distribution

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.600
 now.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.300
lots of

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.700
different mathematical Concepts lots of

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.800
 mathematical notation

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.700
Now I want us to jump to this nor distribution because

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.200
 it will.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.100
Expose us to a number of important Concepts

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.800
 and statistics.

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.400
in one

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.200
in one goal

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.400
Okay, so we will learn different things. We will

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.100
 learn so many things by looking at one example of the

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.900
 normal distribution.

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.900
Which of course once you learn what these ideas are

16
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.000
 then you can apply them to learn.

17
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.000
or every other

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.500
probability distribution out there

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.000
okay, so if

20
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.300
A lot of this is new to you and alien to you. Don't worry.

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.700
First we will immerse ourselves into the notation and

22
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.400
 then we will break down.

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.300
The mathematics so we understand every single the meaning

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.900
 of every single character. That's my intention.

25
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.300
so

26
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.300
here's an example.

27
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.700
By the way for your reference, these examples

28
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300
 are exercises are apart

29
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.700
 from a book.

30
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.200
If you want to know what that book is so you can read it

31
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.100
 more yourself. It's it's at the end of the slide which will be

32
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.500
 shared.

33
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.000
at the end of this Workshop

34
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.100
But let's look at this example.

35
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.600
Let's see how normal distribution can help us solve

36
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.900
 some statistical problems.

37
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
It says that the return on our Diversified

38
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.000
 Investment Portfolio is normal distributed.

39
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.800
What is the probability that the

40
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.000
 return?

41
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.000
Is within one standard of its mean value.

42
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.300
So before I

43
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.100
continue

44
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.800
with the

45
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.900
with a probability distribution

46
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.800
Especially in the context of finance and

47
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.200
 investment and risk.

48
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.000
you want

49
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.100
to have a small standard deviation

50
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.000
for that particular private distribution the smaller

51
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.400
 the standard deviation. The closure will

52
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.700
 be towards the mean.

53
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.400
Which means that?

54
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.100
You are less likely to have variation and less

55
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.500
 variation means less risk.

56
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500
Okay, just to give you some context.

57
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.100
Here. Do you want to see the reason they're concerned with

58
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.200
 the probability being within one standard deviation is because again,

59
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.500
 they want minimum risk.

60
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.200
So what is a probability that the return is within one standard deviation of its mean

61
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.600
 value. This question can be asked without either knowing Mrs.

62
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 So we don't need to know these.

63
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.400
With the we don't need to know these variables as long

64
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.800
 as the distribution is known to be normal. In other

65
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.200
 words. The answer is the same for any normal distribution.

66
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.000
Okay.

67
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.700
so
