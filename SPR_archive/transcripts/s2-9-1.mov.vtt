00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, so, let's see how this works.

1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.300
Okay.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.200
I will type in the

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.500
formula I'll calculate and then I'll try to

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.700
 visually explain to you.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.000
How it works.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.400
Coming back to Wolfram Alpha.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.000
This is the function.

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.600
For the standards know what distribution okay, what we

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
 want to do is because this is not the whole

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.300
 story.

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.800
We actually want to

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.400
integrate

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.100
this function

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Okay.

15
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800
So we want to integrate.

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.000
this function

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.100
Of course with respect to Z.

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.400
this function is going to give us the

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.100
the probability of a single

20
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.200
experiment

21
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.200
But if you want to take the acute the cumulative.

22
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.100
probability of a range of values

23
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.500
you have to integrate why integrate again.

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.100
Because we're dealing with continuous values. We will end

25
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.500
 up with a curve distribution and if you want to measure this area, that's where

26
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.100
 integration comes in.

27
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.000
So what I want to do is integrate.

28
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.800
From one standard from one negative standard deviation to

29
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.200
 the positive standard deviation.

30
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.300
To see how we arrived at that

31
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.500
 particular probability number.

32
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.800
So we actually want to integrate.

33
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.700
So what we'll do is going back to Wolfram.

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.400
Is we want to integrate you will now see if you

35
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.500
 don't recognize latex. You will now see it's

36
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.400
The mathematical syntax now, we want to integrate from negative

37
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.600
 Infinity from the left side of the probability distribution,

38
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200
 right since the probability distribution when it's

39
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.800
 normalized will be shifted to zero and then towards

40
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.400
 the left of zero, we have negative numbers obviously and then

41
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.800
 positive that right. So what we want to do is we want to count accumulate from

42
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.700
 the left so we go from negative Infinity.

43
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.800
two negative 1

44
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.100
the first standard deviation

45
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.500
Okay, and of course, we're driving integrating.

46
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.500
for Z

47
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.600
Let's hit equal and you'll see in mathematical

48
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.900
 format.

49
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.900
Did I type it correctly?

50
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.000
No, did I leave something out infinity? And

51
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.000
 this has to be here?

52
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.800
Yeah, there we go.

53
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.000
So

54
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.800
what has just happened?

55
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500
What has happened if I go back to?

56
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.400
That normal distribution. Let me see if I can find one where we

57
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.200
 have the numbers plotted. I'll find a

58
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.500
 picture here.

59
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600
No one will distribution.

60
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.700
Send it at zero.

61
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.600
Then we should have.

62
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.400
Yeah, this will do.

63
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.100
So what we have done?

64
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400
What has just now happened?

65
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.700
Is we have calculated?

66
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.800
the area

67
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.600
Or come on now.

68
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.300
Yeah, what we have done just done is we

69
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.100
 have integrated.

70
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.300
We have calculated the area.

71
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.400
all the way from negative Infinity up to negative 1

72
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.400
Okay, so we know.

73
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.300
the cumulative probability

74
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.800
of this region

75
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.800
Then what we will do.

76
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.200
is calculate

77
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.500
the

78
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.300
cumulative probability from negative Infinity all to

79
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.300
 positive 1

80
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.000
We will then subtract it to.

81
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.400
And when we subtract the two we will then know. What is a

82
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.600
 probability.

83
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.600
That the experiments will fall.

84
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.500
within one standard deviation

85
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.100
Okay. I hope that's clear other. If not,

86
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.700
 we will revisit this idea again.

87
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.300
What we've done up to this point is we've calculated this part

88
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.900
 now we need to continue.

89
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.800
positive one

90
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.400
then we will take that region the area of

91
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.300
 that curve that portion of the curve subtracting subtracted

92
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.600
 with this.

93
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.500
area of the curve to then

94
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.700
arrive at the the correct probability

95
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.200
 the number

96
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.500
probability

97
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.100
So let's close this.

98
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.800
So first we go from

99
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.300
negative Infinity to negative one

100
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.400
that gives us 0.15.

101
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.000
And you know 0.158655. Is it

102
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.900
 here is a listed on the example. Let's see.

103
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.800
Yes, there it is. Okay.

104
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.000
So this is how you do it.

105
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800
five of negative 1

106
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.600
5 of 1 standard deviation towards the left gives you a

107
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.500
 point 15.86 866 you integrate

108
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.600
 this. So you integrate the five function.

109
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.900
And you arrive at this number? That's how we have.

110
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.400
0.158655

111
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.800
then we do it again, but we go all the way to

112
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.500
positive one

113
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.800
And naturally that's going to give us.

114
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.300
0.841 blah blah blah and then

115
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.400
 you set like I said, you subtract these two, okay, but let's first finish

116
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.700
 with

117
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.000
this idea

118
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.100
wherever yes, here we go. This is it. This

119
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.600
 is how you do it.

120
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.000
So you integrate?

121
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.400
You integrate from negative Infinity up to

122
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.500
 that standard deviation. Let's say if if this were

123
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.700
 if you wanted to know if it falls within two two standard

124
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.500
 deviations that you would go from negative Infinity to negative 2, and then

125
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.100
 again from negative Infinity integrate from negative Infinity all the

126
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.200
 way to positive two so objective to get your

127
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.400
To determine whether it falls within you know.

128
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.500
0.67 probably percent

129
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.200
 probability 90 95% probably 99% probably

130
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.800
 and so on.
