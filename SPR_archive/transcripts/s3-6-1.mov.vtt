Here's a list.

1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.500
of

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.900
the concepts that we want to understand intuitively.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.800
Because understanding them.

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.300
intuitively will make your

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.700
Journey

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.100
to learning regression analysis much easier

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.400
You see the syntax. There are two

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.000
 issues again when it comes to learning.

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.500
statistics in general but specifically learning regression analysis

10
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.500
You have the syntax.

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
Like the mathematical notation. I just showed an example

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.500
 where

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.700
one Greek letter is used to mean something.

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.400
Different something specific in hypothesis, testing what

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.200
 in regression analysis that same letter is used to mean

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.000
 something completely different.

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000
one is the notation is the

18
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.200
the problem the second and I would

19
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.900
 say bigger problem.

20
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.200
Is how these terms are defined?
