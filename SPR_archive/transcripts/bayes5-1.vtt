00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.400
okay, now let's look at

1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.000
How we can go from conditional probability?

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.900
To the Bayesian theorem. Now there's a lot of mathematical expression

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.300
 as you can see here, but we'll take it one step at

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:12.400
 a time.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000
So we are going to go from conditional probability to the Bayesian

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.300
 theorem.

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.300
Now what you need to know is that there are different ways you can express.

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.400
the Basin theorem

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.500
Let's see how we can derive the Bayesian theorem from from conditional probability.

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.700
So here we are told that the

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.800
 probability of a given B.

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500
Is equal to this is this expression?

13
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.100
The probability of BNA over the probability of B.

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.900
had we

15
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.700
swapped

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.800
BNA

17
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.300
or rather had we swapped in B with BNA we would have gotten

18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.900
a similar

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.700
expression on the right

20
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.400
And sit in the denominator the instead in the denominator,

21
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.000
 we would have had.

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.300
A instead of B.

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
The numerator is obviously are equivalent.

24
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.900
When you performed the intersection of two sets.

25
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.800
It is commutative. So the order doesn't matter.

26
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.500
But let's talk about equation one.

27
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.100
if we take

28
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.100
probability of B

29
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.100
and multiply

30
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.100
in both sides

31
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.000
So probability of B here and here.

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.100
Probability of B would be canceled out.

33
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.000
From the denominator and it will appear here.

34
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.600
on the left

35
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.500
so we would get this.

36
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.900
equation

37
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.100
Okay, as you can see probability of

38
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.900
 B has moved from the denominator.

39
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.000
Over here to the left.

40
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.100
Had we done the same thing.

41
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.700
for equation 2 where we canceled or

42
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.000
 where we multiply the probability of a

43
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.900
on both sides of the equation

44
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.700
We would have gotten.

45
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.800
this

46
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.100
so probability of a has moved from the

47
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.700
 denominator.

48
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.300
Here to the left.

49
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.600
Now, please click close attention to these two equations

50
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.900
 equations, three and four.

51
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.600
it might be a good idea for you to

52
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.500
Pause here. And then

53
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.100
Go back to the start of the video. Make sure you've seen what

54
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.000
 we've done so far. All we've done is Multiplied

55
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.100
 both sides of the equation.

56
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.700
With the marginal probability to move from the right to the left to Move

57
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.400
 It from the denominator to the left.

58
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.500
but anyway

59
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.300
We said that these two.

60
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.800
Can be moved around?

61
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.800
Intersection is a commutative probability is

62
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800
 a commutative operation. So whether

63
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.400
 we say probability of BNA

64
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.100
or the probability of A and B is the same

65
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.300
 thing.

66
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.500
in other words

67
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.700
equation 1

68
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.600
excuse me equation 3

69
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.600
is equivalent to equation 4.

70
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.600
and if the equations are well equal to

71
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.900
 one another not a

72
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.700
if the equations are equal to one another

73
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.400
then the terms on each side

74
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.200
 of the equal sides are also equivalent.

75
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.700
So

76
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.900
if probability of B and A.

77
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.000
Is equal to that?

78
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.700
And we said that intersection is commutative, which means this.

79
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.900
Is also equal to that.

80
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.100
And we can see that probability of A and B is equal to that.

81
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.300
That means the probability of BNA.

82
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.300
is equal

83
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.100
to that

84
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.400
and if I remove these two expressions here

85
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 in the middle, we will get this.

86
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.000
They are equivalent.

87
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.700
If we were to divide.

88
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.600
both sides of the equation

89
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.000
With the probability of B.

90
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.500
that it would have

91
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.400
then we would have equation five b.

92
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.400
Right. We move probability of B to the

93
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.800
 other side.

94
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.000
It's now the denominator.

95
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.300
but

96
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.700
up here an equation 5

97
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.600
we set that the probability of B and the probability

98
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.400
 of B given a times probably of B is equivalent to

99
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.500
 the probability of a given B

100
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.700
 times the probability of B.

101
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.700
So another way to write this.

102
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.600
is that

103
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.700
These two are equivalent.

104
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.400
Okay.

105
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.700
Again, it's a good idea for you to maybe write this down.

106
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.200
And you work your way up to this point

107
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.400
 before you continue.

108
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.600
Alright, let's move down. Let's move on.

109
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.800
The probability of B.

110
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.600
We can replace this marginal probability

111
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.900
 with the sum of joint probabilities.

112
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.400
If you remember from the example where we had the table

113
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.200
 of frequencies.

114
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.100
and the marginals

115
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.200
we saw that the probability of B.

116
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.700
was the sum of its intersection with

117
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.200
 a

118
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.200
and the interest and within the intersection of the complement of

119
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.500
 a

120
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.900
To refresh your memory. Let me pull up that example.

121
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.100
this example

122
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600
probability of BNA

123
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.200
will give you five probability of B and not

124
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.400
 a or the complement of a also 5.

125
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.200
add these up and you will get

126
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.700
the sum

127
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.900
which is equal to the marginal probability.

128
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.300
Okay. So again.

129
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.100
The probability of B.

130
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.500
is equal to

131
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.800
the sum of these joint probabilities

132
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:22.900
This is true.

133
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.100
No matter what the events are.

134
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.900
now

135
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.400
probably of BNA for bring your attention

136
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.600
 here.

137
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.700
We said that this is equivalent to

138
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.200
up here

139
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.800
We said that this is equivalent to this expression.

140
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:02.800
Yes.

141
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.000
We said that.

142
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.100
the probability of b and a is equal to

143
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.300
the probability of B and the probability of b and a

144
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.100
 is equal to this expression.

145
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.400
But we also said that this expression.

146
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.100
Is equal to that expression?

147
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.400
And so we can substitute.

148
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.000
The probability of B and A.

149
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:34.100
with

150
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.900
this expression by equivalence

151
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.500
By equivalence we can replace this.

152
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.600
with that

153
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.500
similarly

154
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.300
We can replace this.

155
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.200
with a similar looking expression except here instead of

156
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.600
 a we have to complement a

157
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.300
And this is what?

158
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.800
We are going to use.

159
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.300
We're going to use this form of the

160
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.500
 Bayesian theorem at the next example.

161
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.400
Now this is the probability version.

162
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.100
There is also a likelihood version of The Basin theorem.

163
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.800
But that's for the next section.

164
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.400
But it's important for you to see that.

165
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.800
the busy theorem looks

166
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.500
simple

167
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:48.200
but it

168
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.500
requires this axiomatic thinking to understand how

169
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.200
 we could go from conditional probability to different.

170
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.800
Algebraic arrangements and even the Bayesian

171
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.400
 theorem can take on different forms, which is why if we were to

172
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.600
 look up PC and Theorem online.

173
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.300
You would see that this formula is expressed in

174
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:10.900
 different ways.

175
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.900
And that is because of equivalence.

176
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.300
We can do so.

177
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.000
It will be a good idea.

178
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.100
For you to try to do this yourself as well as an exercise.

179
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.600
Go from conditional probability.

180
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.300
to the Bayesian theorem
