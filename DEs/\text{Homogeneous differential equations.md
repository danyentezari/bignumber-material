\text{Homogeneous differential equations have several distinct meanings:}

1. Homogeneous ODE:
   A first-order ordinary differential equation of the form:  
   $$ M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0 $$  
   is homogeneous if both $M(x, y)$ and $N(x, y)$ are homogeneous functions of the same degree.

2. Homogeneous Linear ODE:
   A linear differential equation of the form:  
   $$ a_n(x) y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x) y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y = 0 $$  
   is homogeneous if the function on the right-hand side is zero.

3. Homogeneous PDE:
   A partial differential equation (PDE) is homogeneous if every term in the equation contains the dependent variable or its derivatives. For example:  
   $$ u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 $$  
   is a homogeneous PDE.

4. Homogeneous boundary conditions:
   Boundary conditions are homogeneous if they set the solution or its derivatives equal to zero on the boundary, e.g., $u(0) = 0$.

5. Homogeneous system of differential equations:  
   A system of linear differential equations is homogeneous if all the forcing functions (right-hand side) are zero:
   $$ A \mathbf{y'} + B \mathbf{y} = 0 $$



# Homogeneous Differential Equations

- **Homogeneous Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**
  - **Homogeneous First-Order ODE**
    - General form: `M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0`
    - Example: `(x^2 + y^2)dx - 2xydy = 0`
  - **Homogeneous Linear ODE**
    - General form: `a_n(x)y^(n) + a_{n-1}(x)y^(n-1) + ... + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = 0`
    - Example: `y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = 0`

- **Homogeneous Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**
  - **Homogeneous Linear PDE**
    - General form: `L(u) = 0`, where `L` is a linear operator
    - Example: `u_t = Î±u_xx`
  - **Homogeneous Non-linear PDE**
    - Equation where all terms involve the dependent variable and its derivatives
    - Example: `u_xx + u_yy = u^2`

- **Homogeneous Systems of Differential Equations**
  - **Linear System**
    - General form: `A * y' + B * y = 0`
    - Example: `{ y'_1 = y_2, y'_2 = -y_1 }`

- **Homogeneous Boundary Conditions**
  - General form: `y(a) = 0` or `y'(a) = 0` at boundary points
  - Example: `y(0) = 0`, `y(L) = 0`
