### 1. Short definition:
Conditions specified at the boundaries of a domain.

### 2. Long definition:
Boundary conditions are constraints imposed on the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) at the boundary of the domain in which the equation is defined. They are necessary to obtain a unique solution for the PDE and describe the behavior of the system at the edges of the region being studied. Common types include Dirichlet (fixed values), Neumann (fixed derivative values), and Robin (a combination of both). Boundary conditions are crucial in fields like physics and engineering to model real-world phenomena accurately.

None at the moment.

### 6. Example 1:
In a heat conduction problem, if a metal rod is insulated at both ends, the boundary condition could be that the temperature gradient (heat flux) at the ends is zero. This corresponds to a Neumann boundary condition:
$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(0, t) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(L, t) = 0
$$
where \( u(x,t) \) represents the temperature in the rod, and \( L \) is the length of the rod.

### 7. Example 2:
For a vibrating string fixed at both ends, the boundary condition specifies that the displacement at the endpoints remains zero, corresponding to a Dirichlet boundary condition:
$$
u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0
$$
where \( u(x,t) \) is the displacement of the string, and \( L \) is the length of the string. These conditions ensure that the string does not move at its endpoints.
