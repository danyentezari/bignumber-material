### Solutions of Differential Equations

**method of undetermined coefficients** The following are steps for finding a particular solution of the second-order linear equation with constant coefficients

$$ay^{\prime\prime}+by^{\prime}+cy=f(x)$$

where the nonhomogeneous term $f(x)$ is a polynomial, exponential, sine, or cosine function or some product of these functions.

- Step 1. Solve the corresponding homogeneous equation.

- Step 2. Pick the form for a particular solution $y_{p}(x)$ depending on the nonhomogeneous term $f(x)$ Remember that no term in the particular solution may also be a solution of the homogeneous equation. If agreement occurs, multiply $y_{p}(x)$ by $x$.
  
- Step 3. Substitute $y_{p}(x)$ and its derivatives into the differential equation and set the coefficients of the algebraic expressions on each side of the equation equal to each other, getting a system of equations for which one can solve for the undetermined coefficients.

- Step 4. Solve the system of equations for the undetermined coefficients. It is possible, using the principle of superposition, to use the method of undetermined coefficients when the nonhomogeneous term contains sums of the forms described in the previous rules. The following example illustrates this idea.
