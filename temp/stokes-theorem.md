# The General Stokes Theorem

$$
\int_{\partial \Omega} \omega = \int_{\Omega} d\omega
$$

where

- $\omega$: A differential form on the manifold $\Omega$.
- $d\omega$: The exterior derivative of $\omega$.
- $\Omega$: A smooth oriented manifold.
- $\partial \Omega$: The boundary of the manifold $\Omega$.

## Manifold

If a surface is a generalization of a curve, then a manifold is the generalization of both surfaces and curves.

Here's another way to understand a manifold.

A curve is a one-dimension manifold.
A surface is a two-dimension manifold.

Beyond two dimensions, we just call these things n-manifold, where $n$ is the number of dimensions.
