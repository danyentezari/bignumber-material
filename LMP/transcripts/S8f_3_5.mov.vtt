That's step five is to of course find the eigenvector for

1
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.500
 the second eigenvalue.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.600
I'm going to skip the steps just to save time but

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.300
 when we solve for the second eigenvalue, which

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.600
 is equal to 4 so I can value top two

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.100
 is the four eigenvalue sub one we say is equal to 1.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.300
We will get a second eigenvector.

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.200
V sub two

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.900
with components

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.400
one one

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.900
With these together we can construct The Matrix. So let's proceed to

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.300
 the next step.

12
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.600
step 6
