00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.700
So let me show you an example. Let's let's switch to markdown talk

1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:03.800
 about.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Let's see a system of equation as in.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.600
In practice and we're matrices come

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.000
 into the picture.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.100
Okay, you want to look here on the right?

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.300
Okay, I'm gonna type markdown markdown code.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.300
But you look at it right by the way, if you want to learn about

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.400
 markdown a latex, which I'm going to be using you can also go to

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.000
 the dashboard. There's a there's some reading material which you can

10
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.300
 check out.

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.700
linear program example

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.400
So let's say this is our objective function.

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.100
Okay, we want to either maximize

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 or minimize this so we want to modify

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.200
 the parameters or find out what X and

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.500
 Y must be equal to so that this function will give us the maximum

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.100
 value or the minimum value. It depends on the problem. If you try

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.900
 to reduce costs that you would want to minimize the function.

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.400
If you want to for example increase Revenue then obviously it

20
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.600
 want to maximize a function.

21
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800
Oh one notation that you might see is for example.

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.500
The cute this word Max that's used before.

23
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.400
the functions name

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.700
so you may have seen this.

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200
So this this says maximize the value and then there's

26
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 something called ARG Max.

27
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.500
Which means the arguments that maximize the

28
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.700
 function?

29
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.300
Okay.

30
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.500
So we want to maximize this function.

31
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.800
And these are the constraints that we have.

32
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.900
Okay.

33
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.800
We have this inequality.

34
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.600
We have these two inequalities in both X and Y Must Be.

35
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.500
Greater than or equal to greater than equal to

36
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.000
 0. Yes.

37
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.600
Now the way we solve this.

38
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
The way we can the way we deal with.

39
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.600
These inequalities as we must solve them.

40
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.400
And what we're about to do is very similar to what we will do with systems of

41
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 linear equations and linear programming where we get to something called the reduced

42
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.100
 Echelon form. I'll show you a picture of it in a moment.

43
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.300
so what we do first is we represent the inequalities

44
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.800
 not as inequalities, but

45
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.100
 as equations like so

46
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.800
so

47
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.000
these are the constraints.

48
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.000
as

49
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.800
equations

50
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600
So these are inequalities.

51
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.500
These are equations. Okay. All we've

52
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.200
 done is we've substituted the inequality with equal sign.

53
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.600
That's let's label this equation. You want an equation two. Now

54
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.200
 what we want to do again is find the roots of

55
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.300
both of these equations

56
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.000
So we want to know what x is equal to Y is equal and what

57
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.100
 Y is equal to once we find what x and y equal to then we will

58
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.400
 find a point that we could put place in the quadrant

59
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 and one of the and irrelevant quadrant.

60
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
And by doing that we will have found a feasible region.

61
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.900
So what we will do.

62
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.900
Is we will subtract?

63
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.700
the second equation from the first

64
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.400
so we will subtract.

65
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.600
2X

66
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.200
from X Y from Y and 4,000 and

67
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.100
 one 3000 so we will subtract these together.

68
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.400
Okay.

69
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.200
And what does that give us?

70
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.400
It gives us x equals to 1,000. Why because well if

71
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.000
 you subtract y from y y is eliminated 2x minus

72
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.800
 X, that's just X and 4,000 minus 3,000. That's

73
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.400
 just 1000 again. This

74
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.200
 is classical laundry, right if you remember this is why I said they're pretty

75
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.500
 regular for linear algebra is classical algebra.

76
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.400
 This is just you know,

77
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.500
Adding on both sides subtracting your both sides

78
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.900
 moving terms the other side of the equation.

79
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.100
Okay, so if you know these then

80
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.600
the linear programming and linear algebra are within your

81
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.300
 grasp.

82
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.600
Okay. So now we have found the first.

83
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.200
Root, we found the first variable X must

84
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.200
 be equal to 1000. Well, now we can do is we can

85
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200
 plug in X into one of these inequalities. So what we will

86
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.800
 do is we will plug in X into equation to

87
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.600
okay, so we will put 1,000 here

88
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.200
 for x and then we will solve for y.

89
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.400
And we do that.

90
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600
We will get the following.

91
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.600
Right. All you can see we've done is

92
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.500
We have plugged in 1004. Excuse me. We've applied we'll plug

93
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.300
 the 1,000 for x.

94
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.200
Actually, yeah for here.

95
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.100
So here we have X Plus y equals 3,000 now we have 1,000 plus

96
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.100
 y equals 3,000.

97
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.500
And then we just solve for y which gives us.

98
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:52.600
2000

99
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.400
now what we have done is we found.

100
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.400
Y as well, so we have the points.

101
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.300
X and Y

102
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.200
and what are these points equal to?

103
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.800
X is 1000

104
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.000
and Y is 2,000.

105
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.200
Okay.

106
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.700
Now if I want to show you a picture of this.

107
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.700
feasible region

108
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.300
There we go there the the other points. So that

109
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.500
 is our first constraint that is our second constraint. We

110
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.800
 use we perform arithmetic operation

111
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.000
 on both of them. We see in this case. All we did was subtract now

112
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.700
 practice.

113
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.200
You're gonna you're gonna have more than two constraints and

114
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.100
 you're going to do a lot more.

115
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.900
row operations

116
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.300
something in linearity. I'll cut this in moment. But as

117
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.200
 you can see once we have found the point once we have found the roots,

118
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.500
 we now have or are able to plot the feasible

119
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.900
 region.

120
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.300
So as long as the parameters.

121
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.600
Are within this feasible region then our objective function is optimized.

122
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.100
And I can optimization means that the function will give us maximum.

123
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.300
Results or minimum results depending on what we're trying

124
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.400
 to do.

125
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.200
This is essentially what linear programming is.

126
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.600
Okay. Now obviously this is a very simple example, there's more something that

127
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.100
 we also cover in this code is called a Simplex algorithm.

128
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.800
And if you learn

129
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.200
 linear programming, then you can even attach something called

130
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.700
 nonlinear programming where you're constraints are

131
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.200
 not linear, so they are polynomials.

132
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.200
Okay.

133
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.000
There's a that was a simple example now.

134
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.400
Let's see how this relates to linear algebra. Let me open another tab here.

135
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.500
 This is an example in linear algebra.

136
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.700
so if we take

137
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.900
a sequence of equations that are set of equations like so

138
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.700
again, you want to look here right in this panel.

139
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.300
Let me activate it.

140
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.500
here again we have

141
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.100
A set of linear equations I can how

142
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.200
 do we know it's linear all of the variables or I should

143
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200
 say. None of the variables are

144
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.600
to the power of two or above everything is the power of one.

145
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.300
That's why it's called linear produces a line. There was a square

146
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.700
 or

147
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.300
If it was square or cubed, then

148
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.800
 we would we would looking at curves.

149
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.200
What we do a linear algebra is we take all of

150
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.100
 these terms both from the left and right side of the

151
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.500
 equation.

152
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.100
And we isolate the constants like so.

153
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.400
So we take two.

154
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.700
And one and one from XYZ respectively,

155
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.600
 so that's what we get here.

156
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.900
and then of course the fourth column

157
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.500
is a

158
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.500
the value of the rights of the equation

159
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.200
The way we would solve this what we do is we have

160
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.200
 the essentially find the roots. We have to find out what x is equal to what Y is

161
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.000
 equal to what Z is equal to.

162
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.900
By eliminating these constants like

163
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.300
 we did in the linear program example.
