00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.900
So abstract algebra.

1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.200
We have words like groups Rings Fields Etc

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.400
 such and I'm going to show you the others.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.000
works this way

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.700
you have a set.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.600
To which some specific actions apply

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.300
 and then if you add or remove axioms you

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.700
 then get another set. So for example, we have something called a billion group.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.500
a billion group

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.600
a billion group. Does anyone know the synonym for the a billion

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.700
 group?

11
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.500
A problem with these synonyms. I mean exactly a commutative

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.700
 group.

13
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.800
commutative commutative

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300
and what is it called the commutative because

15
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.400
 we have axioms one to four plus a

16
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.800
 fifth.

17
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.800
Axiom

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.000
Which is commutative.

19
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.100
simply means if you multiply 8 times B is the same

20
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.600
 thing as multiplying B times a

21
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.400
now, of course, it will come across certain sets in linear

22
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.800
 algebra where this is not the case.

23
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200
because for example if you want to multiply a row by a

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.400
 matrix

25
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.700
Yeah, what am I saying? A vector multiplied by matrix. You

26
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.200
 cannot turn them around.

27
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.000
So what is it in if you want to

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.100
 multiply a vector with a matrix the number of

29
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.500
 columns must match the number of rows.

30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.500
So you can't just commit them around it's

31
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 not the same thing. Okay.

32
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.600
But anyway, this is not specific to vectors and

33
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.500
 matrices is just

34
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.400
it can apply to different types of sets different types

35
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 of mathematical objects.

36
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.100
And then we have a ring.

37
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.000
Let me just copy paste the whole.

38
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800
Set of axioms.

39
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.000
And you'll see what I'm going with this in a very

40
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.400
 shortly.

41
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.200
We haven't we have the ring.

42
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.000
A set to which the following actions apply you have associativity for

43
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.600
 addition.

44
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.400
Commutativity for addition there. Is this zero

45
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.800
 element.

46
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.500
So there's an element. This is incorrect.

47
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.800
 By the way plus 0 is a

48
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.800
A plus zero is it?

49
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.200
Okay.

50
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.900
There is added inverse.

51
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.300
So similar to what we saw with the group, there's an

52
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.600
 element the inverse of which will give you.

53
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.000
That one gave us identity. This one gives us zero they

54
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.500
 cancel it for here. In addition. They cancel each other out we of

55
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.200
 course have associativity. This is from multiplication. So Associated

56
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.900
 within Community for addition and the

57
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.200
 same for multiplication and then there's Unity.

58
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.900
Like with groups and then there is the distributive law.

59
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.400
Then there is a special type of ring.

60
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.600
Called the integral domain.

61
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.400
And this is a set. It's the type of ring. It

62
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.100
 is a set. Of course. Well the axioms 128 but

63
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.600
 not seven.

64
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.700
So Unity does not apply to an integral domain.

65
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.700
Then there is the field. This is the word we encountered

66
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.800
 when we're talking about linear algebra.

67
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.600
So linear algebra.

68
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.100
Is a type of rain.

69
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.500
With axioms want to wait that has all eight Axiom plus

70
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.400
 a ninth accent the multiplicative inverse.

71
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.200
That's what a field is.

72
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.700
Now ideally don't know where these names came from ring. I

73
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.300
 remember remember seeing a very fascinating page.

74
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.600
And there was illustration about it forming a ring. I don't

75
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.500
 remember unfortunately, but the names

76
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.700
 in my opinion, they're not very intuitive.

77
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.700
Like why field?

78
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.700
you know, they're not helpful, but

79
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.500
that's how it is.

80
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.500
now

81
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.500
so I hope it's clear. What I feel is right a field is a set

82
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.700
 with

83
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.800
or I should say to which these rules apply.

84
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.500
That seems are rules. So this is the active

85
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.500
 means something that is true for all the elements

86
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.200
 of that set.

87
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.700
Okay, so to all of the elements in a ring,

88
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.300
 you can apply these rules. This is this is

89
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.000
 true. Well, why is why it is

90
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.400
 even helpful because these axioms will help will

91
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.600
 give you confidence.

92
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.300
That whenever you apply such operations to any element of

93
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.300
 the set you can be sure.

94
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.300
It will it will hold?

95
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.400
If you're doing things like proofs or if you're

96
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 from deleting a model axioms will really help you

97
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.400
 get to a solution faster. Anyway, that is

98
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.300
 so a field is basically a ring, but we also

99
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.500
 have a ninth Axiom the multiplicative

100
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.900
 inverse.

101
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.600
so

102
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.000
we will see examples of vectors when

103
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.600
 you multiply by its inverse. You will

104
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.700
 get the original vector.

105
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.700
This is not something you can do to objects and

106
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.200
In the in the let's say integer number system.

107
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.300
Okay.

108
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.600
So let's return back to this.

109
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.400
linear algebra tutorials scaler multiplication

110
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.000
and this has to be

111
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.200
I will use.

112
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.000
C to stand for component

113
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.400
Yes, I hope we can see that this the ball so that that's a vector. That's a

114
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.800
 constant.

115
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.500
Multiply the scalar by the vector you will get and you

116
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.400
 will get another Vector you will get a vector that obvious. That

117
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.600
 would be a subset at the backer space.

118
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.700
Okay.

119
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.700
and

120
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.800
these are vector.

121
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.200
I will say here that this is a subset of the

122
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.500
 real.

123
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.200
number system

124
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.700
and this is a

125
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.000
constant component

126
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.900
Let me now show you.

127
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.300
A linear combination what is linear combination?

128
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.000
linear combination

129
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.100
and let me talk about our

130
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.600
to the power n what does this mean?

131
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.400
let's say

132
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.400
to the power 3

133
00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.900
What does this mean? So basically?

134
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.400
You will get a set.

135
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.000
Let's use the word space to be consistent with

136
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.500
 linear algebra terminology with any three

137
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.600
 letters elements or

138
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.200
 components any points all of which belong

139
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.100
 inside the real numbers system such that such

140
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.400
 that

141
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.000
A B C all of them are in

142
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.300
Are or there is a real number

143
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.500
 system.

144
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.200
Okay. So for example, this could be a point

145
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.700
 in a three-dimensional space.

146
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.400
Or could just be a vector.

147
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.400
It doesn't necessarily have to be a point on

148
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.300
 a coordinate space. It just could be a set with three elements in

149
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:48.300
 it.

150
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.900
So that's what this this means.

151
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.300
So for example R to the power 5 same thing a b c.

152
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.400
d

153
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.200
This should be our.

154
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.100
Okay, so here it says we have so now that we know what

155
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.400
 that is.

156
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.600
the linear combination

157
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.800
a linear combination is let's say we have vectors.

158
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.200
And here I'm using the boulders V2 from

159
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.200
 V1 to VK, by the way when I see and or k

160
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.200
 or some subscript like that either pick the number three or

161
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.600
 the number five.

162
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.700
Helps me visualize things. So let's say we have five vectors. This

163
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.400
 is a vector 1 2 3 4 5 all of them

164
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.100
 are for example three in three dimensions.

165
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.300
Associated with each Vector is a constant.

166
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.900
Which are real numbers so we can see there's no superscript here

167
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.700
 because these are scalars.

168
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.100
So what's an example of a linear combination something that

169
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:47.700
 looks like this?

170
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.200
Evaluate this expression.

171
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.100
And you have your linear combination?

172
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.000
Now what's a linear span?

173
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.600
a linear span

174
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.500
is the following

175
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.100
Say we have a vector space.

176
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.500
Basically as a set of vectors A set

177
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.100
 containing vectors.

178
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.800
And we have let's say five vectors.

179
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.200
So we have a space.

180
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.000
a vector space V

181
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.300
with elements

182
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.200
V1 V2 all the way to VK

183
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.500
and then we put these vectors inside a set

184
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.000
 called X.

185
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.800
Okay, so we take the sequence of values. So they're all vectors. We

186
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.700
 put them inside it says inside the set X.

187
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.800
If we apply this linear this linear

188
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.800
 span function to X.

189
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.900
Then we will get the following.

190
00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.400
We will get a set of the linear combination.

191
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.500
 So that's what a linear span is. A linear span is a set of

192
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.900
 linear combination if you remember from we talked about self-proven notation.

193
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.000
We set that.

194
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.100
A this is well, and

195
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.500
 this is a set with these

196
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.000
 elements.

197
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.300
Such that these are

198
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:22.700
 vectors.

199
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.400
And these are the constants.

200
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.200
So linear span is a set of linear combinations.

201
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.800
 So it's a basically a set of these.

202
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.100
That's what a linear span is.

203
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.000
Okay.
