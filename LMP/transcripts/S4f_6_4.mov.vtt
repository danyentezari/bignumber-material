00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.500
So now I need to create a second elimination Matrix to

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.100
 get rid of two.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.600
and then one

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.600
so let's do that. I'm going to copy this.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.600
Make it a identity Matrix again.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.300
And let's see what numbers I need to modify in this identity Matrix

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.800
 to get rid of the two.

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.700
Okay.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.800
To get rid of two.

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.900
I would have to multiply Row 1 by 2.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.600
And then subtract it from the third row.

11
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.100
So negative 2 plus 2 and I will

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.900
 get a leading zero.

13
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.700
So what I'm going to do next is

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.200
so I need to

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.300
multiply

16
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.300
The first row by two and then add it

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300
 so yeah multiply the first row by two.

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.300
negative 2 rather

19
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.200
and then add it to the third row.

20
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800
Yeah, I have to be careful.

21
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.300
So this is what I want.

22
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.200
Multiply the first row by negative 2 add it

23
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.800
 to the third row.

24
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.200
one more time

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.400
There we go.

26
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.700
Now don't worry about the second row because we already have the elimination Matrix

27
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 up here.

28
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300
For the second row. We have the element elimination Matrix. This

29
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.700
 is the elimination Matrix for the third row. So as

30
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.300
 you can see we've gotten it to become.

31
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
A zero, but now there is this negative 3 that also needs

32
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.000
 to be a zero.

33
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400
So I'm going to create a third

34
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.400
 elimination Matrix.

35
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.900
I'm going to take this again.

36
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.300
I'm gonna set this back to zero and let me see what number I must

37
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.600
 use.

38
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.400
to get rid of negative 3

39
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.000
What do you think?

40
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.500
How do we get rid of that?

41
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.700
Negative 3 in the in the middle of the third

42
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.000
 row.

43
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.500
So what I could do.

44
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.000
At 6 over 2. So yes, so at 3 at positive

45
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.600
 3 to that but I need to

46
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.400
use one of these so either have to divide this by

47
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.500
 two.

48
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.400
or I can multiply this by 1.5 2

49
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.000
 times 1.5 gives us 3

50
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.700
so what I can do is multiply.

51
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.500
the first row

52
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.700
by negative

53
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.100
one and a half so three over five is one half.

54
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.100
This is negative 1/2.

55
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.500
And then add that to the third rule so multiply the

56
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500
 first rule by a negative 1.5.

57
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.600
And then add that to the third row.

58
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.200
Okay, hopefully I got this right let me run this and again this needs to

59
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.800
 be three.

60
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.900
This needs to be three.

61
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.700
Let me run this one more time.

62
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.700
So this is the original Matrix the identity Matrix.

63
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.000
Multiply a by the identity Matrix. We'll get

64
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.900
 the original Matrix this and that are equivalent.

65
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.500
Then I came down here.

66
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.800
I took the original Matrix.

67
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.100
These two are the same this one.

68
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.500
I took the original Matrix.

69
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.400
then multiplied three

70
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.400
to the first row

71
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.600
So this would become three three plus minus 3,

72
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.500
 this would become zero.

73
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.900
And that's how we get the zero down here.

74
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.000
So the three has been eliminated.

75
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.800
Then let me just copy this Matrix.

76
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.400
So this is the new a

77
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.600
this is the new way.

78
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.200
Okay, the zero has been eliminated, but now

79
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.000
 I need to get two to be eliminated.

80
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.900
so to get rid of this two, I'm going

81
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.500
 to multiply the first row by

82
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.500
 negative 2 so negative 2 plus 2

83
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.200
And this zero.

84
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.400
And the zero disappear so negative 2 plus 2

85
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.100
 and then 0 will disappear.

86
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600
So I'm going to run this.

87
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.700
Okay.

88
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.500
And there we have it.

89
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.300
The zero has disappeared.

90
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.400
Now we're left with this negative 3, so I'm going to copy this.

91
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.600
and then I'm going to

92
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400
hardcoded

93
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.000
Okay.

94
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.100
So this is where we are now.

95
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.400
The zero has been eliminated here. The zero has been eliminated

96
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.700
 here. But now we need to get rid of this negative 3.

97
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.200
So what I can do, well, I have two twos here.

98
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.100
 I can use either row two or Row 1.

99
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.400
so

100
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.900
I could use either one of these I could multiply the

101
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.300
 second row by 1.5.

102
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.400
And then add it to the third row.

103
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.200
so I can

104
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.300
be careful with my sides here.

105
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.100
I can multiply the second row.

106
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.500
By 1.5. So this becomes three and then

107
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.000
 at 3.

108
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.900
To negative 3 to get this to disappear.

109
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.300
Okay, let me try that now.

110
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.800
And there we have it.

111
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.800
So we are now an upper triangle.

112
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.200
One two negative three and zeros here.

113
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.700
So the L triangle that I'm referring to is going

114
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.800
 to be the final.

115
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.200
Elimination Matrix. So what do I mean?

116
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.900
Let me take those. Let me take the the three elimination

117
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.400
 Matrix matrices that I created. So I'm going

118
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.600
 to open a sidebar here.

119
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.600
I'm going to add E1 E2

120
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.600
 and E3 down here. So this is E3.

121
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.500
And then this is E2.

122
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.200
And this is E1.

123
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.400
Okay.

124
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.000
The L. Matrix is going to be.

125
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.500
all three of these matrices put together

126
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.500
so we have

127
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.200
1 0 0

128
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.400
then we have three one zero.

129
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.900
three zero

130
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.900
zero

131
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.000
and then

132
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.700
I have a negative 2 here.

133
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.200
And three over two here, so I'm going to put here negative

134
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.600
 2.

135
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.900
3 over 2

136
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.400
and then zero, so this is what

137
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.900
 I mean by

138
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.600
The L Matrix being the product.

139
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:48.900
of

140
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.900
a sequence of elimination matrices

141
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.100
and this is what I meant to say and this is what I meant when I

142
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.000
 said the

143
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.400
In LED composition we keep track of our operations.

144
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.800
 So it's one thing to write down the steps. It's

145
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.300
 another thing to put them into matrices like so

146
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.400
Okay.
