00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.500
So let's let me show you how we can apply.

1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.800
To Shear to this line, okay.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.400
That's our Vector. I'm going to create here a transformation

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.400
 matrix. So this is our vector.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.700
and

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.200
if I type it out here we will see.

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.300
Okay, I this is I don't want 100

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.200
 points. If you remember I said we can make it only two points. So let me modify this

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.600
 code.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.900
I thought I deleted this little.

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.400
delete this

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.900
delete that.

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.100
one more time

13
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.500
once more click on all

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.900
yeah.

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.200
so

16
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.400
this is x sub 1 x sub 2.

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.500
y sub 1 y sub 2

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.900
so

19
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
X goes from x sub 1

20
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.600
X sub 2 they're all on the same place, but for

21
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 why we go from y sub 1 to Y

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.300
 sub 2 that's that's eight.

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.800
So

24
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.400
I'm going to multiply this Matrix.

25
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.300
With a transformation matrix, so I'm going to go look at

26
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.200
 my code here and let's call this shear.

27
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.200
and this will be a 2 by 2

28
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.700
 just like

29
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.600
in this presentation from I think

30
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 this is UC Urban.

31
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.900
Make sure to give them credit.

32
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.200
Where was this year

33
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.300
 this year?

34
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.200
That's the one.

35
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
So I want to go NP dot array.

36
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.600
and if you remember from the LED composition session

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.400
we said that this is an identity Matrix.

38
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.300
This says key Pro 1 as is.

39
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.200
and this one says keep row two assets if I had done one

40
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.000
 here, then we would be

41
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.200
multiplying or rather adding Row 1 to

42
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.500
 R2

43
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.200
if I do this and I multiply

44
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.400
V1 it's called a vector but it's really a matrix right because

45
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.500
 x sub 1 except to Y sub 1 y sub 2 but anyway,

46
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.300
 if I multiply these two together if I do if I use the mat.

47
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.500
Multiply methods. So this is my

48
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500
 original vector.

49
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.300
I'm going to say V1.

50
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.900
V1

51
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.500
I think when you apply transformation user fee.

52
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.800
I can't use apostrophe here. So I'm just going to use.

53
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.600
transform

54
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
and this will be NP mode multiply.

55
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.400
So the transformation matrix must come first. So Shear times

56
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.500
 V sub 1

57
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.700
and then I'm going to draw.

58
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.100
the vector after I have

59
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.900
applied some geometric transformation

60
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.100
So the original one stay let's make the original one black.

61
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.700
C equals black

62
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.200
and the transformation will be red.

63
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.400
C equals red

64
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.100
now I just complaining because

65
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.300
yeah, because this has to be

66
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.400
A list this has to be honest.

67
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.300
Let's try that again. One, two three.

68
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.500
Okay, and yeah, so obviously the red

69
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.600
 is drawn over the black one because this is still an identity Matrix.

70
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.200
If I want to share it if I want to make it slanted left

71
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.300
 or right I have to change.

72
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.400
this element

73
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.900
So let me try to and of

74
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.400
 course we have to keep in mind our access goes and increments

75
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.700
 of what is this 2.5?

76
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.700
So if I wanted to go 2.5, I'm just gonna make it 2.5. Let's

77
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.400
 see what that does.

78
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.400
Okay, that's a lot. Let me make it.

79
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.600
less than that 0 Maybe

80
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.000
1.25

81
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.600
Oh, that's still too much.

82
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.000
Let's make it.

83
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.800
about this

84
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.100
Okay, I mean, it's still applying Shear, but I know I don't want it to

85
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.700
 be this extreme.

86
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.400
And of course we can go the negative Direction.

87
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.500
Okay.

88
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.600
Let me go whatever as much smarter number.

89
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.600
How about

90
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.400
what is this?

91
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.100
fine

92
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.400
Yeah.

93
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.400
So imagine you have an object.

94
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.400
Like in the video game and you want to make sure it has

95
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.500
 a shadow I can use a sheer effect.

96
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.300
Now what if we want to create a plane our plane if

97
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.500
 you let me borrow this code again?

98
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.200
Paste it here.

99
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.400
And a matrix is a

100
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.100
set of vectors instead of

101
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.600
 row vectors.

102
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.200
So let's say we have the following.

103
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.000
We create a matrix m.

104
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.400
Initially, you will be an empty list.

105
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.400
And now let's say we want to give this Matrix.

106
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.400
10 rows

107
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.400
it will be of

108
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.000
our row of

109
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.600
10 10 rows of vectors

110
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.400
All of them eight which each row

111
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.600
 would be a vector which and will be 8.

112
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.600
points

113
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400
It's like will be 8.

114
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.000
And I'm going to put each row inside the Matrix. So if I run

115
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.200
 this.

116
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.300
Okay. Oh, no, we're not gonna see it just yet. But maybe this is a

117
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.000
if I type an m dot shape.

118
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.600
Okay, so we have 10 rows.

119
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.500
Two by two well, but this is a this is a list of two dimensions.

120
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.100
This is X an X and Y.

121
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.900
Okay.

122
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.000
I'll show you what I mean in a second now if I plot this

123
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.500
 Matrix.

124
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.300
So I'm going to go.

125
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.200
here

126
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.900
alright

127
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.300
Let's make this.

128
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.700
Horror or let's make this V.

129
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.400
For each V in them for each Vector inside the

130
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.700
 Matrix I run this.

131
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.800
So you can see here we have ourselves.

132
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.600
a plane

133
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.100
Okay.

134
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.300
Now if you wanted to look like a plane like we see here.

135
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.300
I can close it. I can close the displacement. I want

136
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.900
 to call if I close this placement here.

137
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.200
I can make them move in a fractions right now. They're

138
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.600
 moving in increments of I think in one increments

139
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.900
 of one.

140
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.800
but if I make this, you know one tenth

141
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.100
you can see now they're

142
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.200
it's starting to look like a rectangle.

143
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.900
Let me make it a little.

144
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.900
increase in displacement and you can see

145
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.400
let me go from five to 100.

146
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.000
to increase the width

147
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.800
Okay, maybe maybe the increased displacement

148
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.500
 and more. Let's go 150.

149
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:20.400
Yeah.

150
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.700
so now if I apply to this like before

151
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.900
so I'm gonna go here.

152
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.000
gonna copy paste this

153
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.200
and multiply this I'm going to go M sub.

154
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.800
transform

155
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.700
multiply the shear matrix by the original

156
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.200
 Matrix

157
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.300
I run this now.

158
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.700
So that's the original one. But if I say m transform

159
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.100
there we have now applied to the Matrix.

160
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.400
Okay.

161
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.000
So this linear transformation works for either the vector?

162
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.700
and the Matrix so after all Matrix is just

163
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.300
you can imagine as a sequence of vectors but not necessarily

164
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.100
 because if you have four points you can we can use

165
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.300
 the fill between method.

166
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.500
to draw
