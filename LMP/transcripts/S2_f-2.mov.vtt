00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.200
review of set

1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.000
theory

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.400
Set builder notation not set theory.

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.500
in the mathematics

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.400
sets are represented with

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.000
curly brackets

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.700
now we have

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.700
Specific types of sets but I'll come down in a moment.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.100
So for example, this is a set.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.600
One two three, right? We have a set with three elements.

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.400
 One, two, three, we use those words.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.300
And we can use a letter to represent it. So we have to set a

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.600
with elements 1 2 3

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.800
now

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.400
a vector

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.400
maybe not jump ahead too quickly. Let's let me call this a vector

16
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.300
 space because we're going to come this in a moment.

17
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
And also if so, this is

18
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.800
 a set we call its these numbers in here. Yeah, it's

19
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.900
 elements and if we want to use such

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.400
 polar notation.

21
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
Let me actually show your set builder notation. Say we have

22
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.800
 the set.

23
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's do a again.

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.900
This time using set builder we can say x such

25
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.300
 that.

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.000
X is an integer

27
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.100
X such that X

28
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.600
Is an integer.

29
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.500
and

30
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.600
X is between

31
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.000
1 and 3

32
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.600
so

33
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.000
X

34
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.000
l e q

35
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.400
3 so what we're doing what this?

36
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
Expression is saying is producer set with elements X.

37
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.400
So we're going to have these x's in this set.

38
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.100
Such that the X's are integers.

39
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.500
I'll tell you what this Z is in a second if it's not clear if

40
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.200
 you haven't seen this before.

41
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.000
And X is between 1 and 3.

42
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.400
So, of course we have the number system. Let me take let me go

43
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.000
 up one level.

44
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.200
And this is we will come to this in a moment. We will

45
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.500
 return to this topic once we get the abstract algebra the number

46
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.800
 systems.

47
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.900
So we have the natural numbers, for example.

48
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.400
Which are indicated with the letter n?

49
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.800
You can see that there is this.

50
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.600
a two lines

51
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.900
so it's not just a normal letter the capital letter and it's it

52
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.300
 looks like that.

53
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.900
And this is the this is the set of numbers.

54
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.000
from

55
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.300
zero

56
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.400
one two

57
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.400
until then

58
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.300
but these are all of course.

59
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.800
their whole numbers

60
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.000
so no.

61
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.700
The whole there's no fraction. And of

62
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.100
 course, they are not signed so.

63
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.300
No positive or negative.

64
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.800
This is the natural numbers.

65
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.200
I won't do all of them just a few of them. So you get the idea and then

66
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.000
 we have the integers.

67
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.100
Which is like the natural numbers, but they also go on the negative side.

68
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.400
So we have negative one.

69
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.200
negative 2 Etc

70
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.400
Okay.

71
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.700
Should have put here Infinity.

72
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.700
Maybe

73
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.600
minus

74
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.900
Okay.

75
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.300
And then we have the real numbers. This one

76
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.500
 will be definitely want to know because

77
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.600
the real numbers are always.

78
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.500
denoted in linear algebra, and that is just the

79
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.700
 set of

80
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.500
rational and irrational numbers

81
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.400
so the numbers like pi and E.

82
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.000
Oil is number. These are irrational numbers.

83
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.300
Because they are not repeating and then we have the rational numbers.

84
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.400
Okay, so we won't get to the complex number system or this

85
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.100
 is sufficient. So if you see

86
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.200
letters that look like this they have

87
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.100
 this line Crossing through the letter.

88
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.600
Then we talk about a number system.

89
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.400
So down here, what are we saying?

90
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.400
we are saying that a

91
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.200
Again, as a set containing elements X

92
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.100
 such that this vertical bar is pronounced.

93
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.900
Or it's red as such that alternatively we

94
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.500
 can use a colon in here like so.

95
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.900
So these are interchangeable.

96
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.800
So X such that X is an integer.

97
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.500
And it is between one and three including one and

98
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.500
 three.
