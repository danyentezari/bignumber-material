00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay. So this of course is our second session.

1
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.700
and unlike the

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.300
first session

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
this we're going to go deeper into mathematics. So we

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.800
 are going to take our time.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.600
to develop

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.800
our mathematical proficiency

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.400
Let me tell you what we are going to be to doing today.

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.600
Okay, so I'm going to pull up the agenda.

9
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.100
Today, which is the 29th of June.

10
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.400
We are going to begin first.

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.800
with a

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.200
very short

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.500
review

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.700
of set

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.600
builder notation

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.100
so not set theory set builder notation.

17
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.200
Review of set builder notation. Why?

18
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.600
because

19
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.500
any book that you pick up?

20
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800
on linear algebra

21
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.100
is going to use a lot of

22
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.800
abstract algebra terminology

23
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.000
the foundation of which is set theory.

24
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
So what I'm trying to say is we're going to learn I'm going to show you the

25
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.500
 basics of set builder notation, which is really simple.

26
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.300
And then once we're all on the same page, we will then

27
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.200
 proceed to talk about some fundamentals of abstract algebra.

28
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.700
 Remember?

29
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.400
Abstract algebra and linear algebra are not separate.

30
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.600
linear algebra depends on abstract algebra, so

31
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.200
 we will talk about abstract algebra to the extent

32
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 that will allow us to

33
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.600
You know talk a linear algebra.

34
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.800
And then once we have done, so

35
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.700
You know, once we have I've shown you the basics of abstract algebra

36
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.600
 also have clarified for you some terminology.

37
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.900
And showing you the syntax.

38
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.000
We could quite literally pick up a textbook. I have a several of

39
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.200
 these on my on my shelf, but for example

40
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700
 this one.

41
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.300
Right or many others and we can just jump right

42
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.700
 into the middle.

43
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.800
And then understand what?

44
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.600
that topic is

45
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.000
in our first session and we will do that together.

46
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.200
Of course.

47
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.000
We're going to do exercises.

48
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.200
Because it is one thing for you to watch.

49
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.300
And instruct your talk about something.

50
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.100
And we know why I explained it. It might make sense to

51
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.400
 you because I'll have the answers. All right in front of you.

52
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.600
but the best way to

53
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.700
Learn or to ensure that you've absolutely absorbed

54
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.600
 everything that has been communicated to is to do exercises.

55
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.400
 So we're going to do an exercise.

56
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.500
on

57
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.200
let me just call it the linear algebra, but there

58
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.900
 are different aspects right there. Is this systems of equations part there

59
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.300
 is the Matrix operations part.

60
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.400
There is a set representation part and then there's even the visualization part

61
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.300
 right which we are going to do by the we want to be able to plot

62
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.800
 points on a Cartesian coordinate

63
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.100
 system.

64
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.600
and two three dimensions

65
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.000
so we want to talk about the

66
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.700
directions of vectors

67
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.400
which you will do as well.

68
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.400
and then

69
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.200
if time allows it, let's see how this session will go

70
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.100
 we want to do we're going to do a

71
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.600
 review of

72
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.700
systems of equations

73
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.700
and then do it exercise on it.

74
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.100
If we don't get to the fifth part.

75
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.500
I want to at least take you through the numpy array.

76
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.400
after all this

77
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.100
Course is based on python, right? We want

78
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.800
 to learn a linear algebra and then Implement what we know in Python.

79
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.700
Because later on we want to see how we can use linear algebra

80
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.200
 techniques.

81
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.100
For examples in economics in transportation

82
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.500
 and big part of his neural

83
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.400
 networks. We talked about this. Okay. Now let me all say

84
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.800
 this to you.

85
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.000
Because none of these courses assume

86
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.500
 prerequisites me. There's no admission criteria, right?

87
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.900
I sometimes adjust

88
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.100
 the pace of the classes.

89
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.300
Okay, so if I see that I'll it's too

90
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.500
 much. We slow it down. We take our time and if

91
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.200
 everyone is familiar with if more people are familiar with the concept,

92
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.700
 but the concepts we can speed it up.

93
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.700
Okay, so which is why I say, let's see how it goes.

94
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.100
Very well.

95
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.200
Now we want to one thing that we

96
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.300
 should have checked ideally is making sure that everybody

97
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.900
 has Python and you put a notebook installed.

98
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.400
Hello, let me ask you this. How many of you have?

99
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.600
You put a notebook on your machines at this time.

100
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.400
If you do type in wife why for yes, otherwise type

101
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.500
 it in. I just want to quickly gauge.

102
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.100
And preparedness. So Richard says yes. Now that says yes.

103
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.100
How about you no one Richard Ron?

104
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.100
Okay, it's that's okay.

105
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.300
 We're not going to do much of.

106
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.100
Python Programming and at least out of the

107
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.800
 session I'm gonna show you some ideas, but we're not going to do program

108
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.400
 right now, but I just keep in mind that there will

109
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.200
 be an assignment.

110
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.100
Using Jupiter notebook

111
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.500
 the numpyre library and matplotlib.

112
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.600
Because if you remember in session what we we plotted the constraints.

113
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.400
Of our LP problem our linear program problem.

114
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.400
 So you you want to do the same?

115
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.700
For the assignment, okay.

116
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.900
All right.

117
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.300
Let's begin with the first item. Excuse me.

118
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.600
and as usual you want to

119
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.900
Look on the right pedal because I'm gonna write latex code

120
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.700
 on the left. So you want to see the results here on the right?

121
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.400
Okay.

122
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.500
And then you make sure when this is recorded.

123
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.800
it doesn't block the

124
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.400
results

125
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.400
Okay.

126
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.700
so

127
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.000
review of set

128
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.900
Theory

129
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.400
Set builder notation not set theory.

130
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.500
and the mathematics

131
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.400
sets all represented with

132
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.000
curly brackets

133
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.700
now we have

134
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.700
Specific types of sets but I'll come down in a moment.

135
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.100
So for example, this is a set.

136
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.600
One two three, right? We have a set with three elements.

137
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.400
 One, two, three, we use those words.

138
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.300
And we can use a letter to represent it. So we have to set a

139
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.600
with elements 1 2 3

140
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:38.800
no.

141
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.400
a vector

142
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.400
maybe not jump ahead too quickly. Let's let me call this a vector

143
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.200
 space because we're going to come this in a moment.

144
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.100
And also if so, this is

145
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.800
 a set we call its these numbers in here. Yeah, it's

146
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.900
 elements and if we want to use such

147
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.400
 polar notation.

148
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.900
Let me actually show your set builder notation.

149
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.800
Say we have the set.

150
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.000
Let's do a again.

151
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.800
This time using set builder we can say x such

152
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.100
 that.

153
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.000
X is an integer

154
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.100
X such that X

155
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.500
Is an integer.

156
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:25.400
and

157
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.500
X is between

158
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.100
one and three

159
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:38.600
so

160
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.000
X

161
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.000
l EQ

162
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.300
3

163
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.800
so what we're doing what this?

164
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.600
Expression is saying is producer set with elements X.

165
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.700
So we're going to have these x's in this set.

166
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.400
Such that the x is our integers.

167
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.500
I'll tell you what this Z is in a second if it's not clear

168
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.600
 if you haven't seen this before.

169
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.300
Add X's between one and three.

170
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.200
So, of course we have the number system. Let me take let me go up one

171
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:14.400
 level.

172
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.200
And this is we will come to this in a moment. We will return to this

173
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.200
 topic once we get to abstract algebra the number systems.

174
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.200
So we have the natural numbers, for example.

175
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.800
Which are indicated with the letter n?

176
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.200
You can see that there is this.

177
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.000
like two lines

178
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.400
So it's not just a normal the capital letter and

179
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.700
 it's it looks like that.

180
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.300
And this is the this is the set of numbers.

181
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:48.400
from

182
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.700
0

183
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.800
1 2

184
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.800
until n

185
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.700
but these are all of course.

186
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.100
now their whole numbers

187
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.400
so no.

188
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.800
The whole there's no fraction.

189
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.600
and of course, they are not signed so

190
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.700
no positive or negative.

191
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.100
This is the natural numbers.

192
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.600
I won't do all of them just a few of them. So you get the idea and then

193
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.400
 we have the integers.

194
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.400
Which is like the natural numbers, but they also go on the negative side.

195
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.800
So we have negative 1.

196
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.500
negative 2 Etc

197
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:31.800
Okay.

198
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.100
Should have put here Infinity.

199
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:42.900
minus

200
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.400
Okay.

201
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.000
And then we have the real numbers. This one will be

202
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:56.900
 definitely want to know because

203
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.000
the real numbers are always.

204
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.300
denoted in linear algebra, and that

205
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.100
 is just a set of

206
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.800
rational and irrational numbers

207
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.700
so the numbers like pi and E.

208
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.300
Oil is number. These are irrational numbers.

209
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.800
Because they are not repeating and then we have the rational numbers.

210
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.500
Okay, so we won't get to the complex number system or

211
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.300
 this is sufficient. So if you

212
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:25.400
 see

213
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.700
letters that look like this they have

214
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.200
 this line Crossing through

215
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:33.500
 the letter.

216
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.100
Then we talking about a number system. So down here.

217
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.800
 What are we saying?

218
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.800
We are saying that a

219
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.300
Again, as a set containing elements

220
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.400
 X such that this vertical bar is pronounced.

221
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.300
Or it's red as such that alternatively we

222
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.800
 can use a colon in here like so.

223
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.200
So these are interchangeable.

224
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.100
So X such that X is an integer.

225
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.200
And it is between one and three including

226
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.900
 one and three.

227
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.000
Okay.

228
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.100
Now now that we know what we've done this quick review of

229
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:10.900
 such let's talk about

230
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.700
a vectors

231
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.600
so of the word space

232
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.900
Really means set.

233
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.300
So why not just say Vector set instead of vector space?

234
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.600
because spaces imply some

235
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:27.700
 sort of

236
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.800
some rules apply

237
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.600
There are some ordering there are some operations you

238
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.600
 can apply to the elements on the set. So we try

239
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.100
 to be more specific.

240
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.000
and

241
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.600
we also want to be careful well.

242
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.400
There's another word here. I want to use element.

243
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.300
Okay, so they would element.

244
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.300
In the in the context of linear algebra.

245
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.400
we

246
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.200
the convention is not to use the word element in a set.

247
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.400
 The convention is to use the word.

248
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.100
Well the scalar.

249
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.600
The scalars of a set so in linear

250
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.200
 algebra and element can be called scalar.

251
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.200
or point

252
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.100
or

253
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.400
component

254
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.300
and it's unlikely free to see a little bit. So we see these all the

255
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.500
 elements elements are all.

256
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.100
synonyms

257
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.900
for members of a

258
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:38.800
matrix

259
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.500
and of course a vector is a type of Matrix.

260
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.900
Okay, so these words are interchangeable.

261
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.000
Okay.

262
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.300
So we can call this point point.

263
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.500
or a component component component

264
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.400
 element element scalar scalar scalar

265
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.500
Interchangeable, unfortunately, that's how it is in mathematics. They

266
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.100
 use different words to refer to

267
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.500
 the same thing.

268
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.100
We don't.

269
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.300
use curly brackets

270
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.700
or curly braces the convention is to use either parentheses.

271
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:26.400
or

272
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.300
square brackets

273
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.900
both are interchangeable.

274
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.300
Okay, let me pull up my notes.

275
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.900
Run asks, which version of python anything version

276
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.600
 through your above? Okay. Let me pull up

277
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:52.700
 the

278
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.000
my notes very quickly. Here we go in your algebra.

279
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.300
Okay.

280
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.300
So what is a vector space?

281
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.500
a vector space

282
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.200
actually, no, hold on. I I don't want to jump this is

283
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.600
 this is supposed to be vector.

284
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:17.600
So

285
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:21.800
vectors

286
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.800
are sets of

287
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.100
elements

288
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.200
however

289
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:36.800
vectors

290
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.000
are conventionally referred

291
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.200
 to

292
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.600
as spaces with scalars

293
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.100
Okay.

294
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:48.700
now

295
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.000
and of course

296
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.200
we use lowercase letters to indicate them. So

297
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.100
 like so

298
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.600
and they will either come.

299
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.100
with an arrow on over them like so

300
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.300
Or like I said in our first session it could be they

301
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.800
 could be bold like so.

302
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:10.800
Okay.

303
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.500
so we call the number either scalars or components of

304
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.600
the vector

305
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.400
Okay.

306
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.500
we also want to talk about

307
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.800
a linear span linear combination

308
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.700
row space and column space

309
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.100
So we have a linear combination.

310
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.300
And then we can do an exercise.

311
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.100
combination

312
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:47.900
then we will do.

313
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:52.800
linear span

314
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100
and the column space

315
00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500
and then the row space.

316
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.000
And before we do this, we'll also talk about matrices.

317
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.100
so we want to

318
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.500
be clear with our

319
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.000
terminology

320
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:17.500
Okay.

321
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.400
Now, let me come to Vector space. Let me actually borrow it

322
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.800
 from the chapter of this book because I thought I'd written it here.

323
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.700
a vector space

324
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.400
okay.

325
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.700
You want 50?

326
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.700
Whenever I'll tell you what?

327
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.000
The books that we we are using here.

328
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.100
Okay.

329
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.200
Just give me a second.

330
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.600
And then one of the exercises we're going to do is Implement these

331
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.200
 with numpy. I turn two vectors

332
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.800
 into numpy arrays.

333
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.300
And then perform arithmetic operations on them 1 1

334
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:08.400
 2.

335
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.200
So for how many of these were already where you

336
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.300
 already familiar with if you've if you if you already know what the if

337
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.300
 you've seen this before if like, you know what they are typing why otherwise also

338
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:22.600
 type in

339
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:24.700
Let's gauge.

340
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.700
your familiarity

341
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:33.800
Okay.

342
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.400
super

343
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.800
Now I'm going to type here the definition of vector space.

344
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.300
But then to probably understand we will have to return to

345
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.100
 abstract algebra.

346
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.400
Okay, we'll have to visit our abstract algebra. So see

347
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.100
 it says here.

348
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.300
That a vector space. So let me just type in definition and

349
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:54.400
 then

350
00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.300
I'll clarify a vector space.

351
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.000
is

352
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.200
Okay, let's say it says V.

353
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.200
on a minute

354
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.000
Yeah is a vector space over the field K Over

355
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.600
 the field?

356
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.200
Okay.

357
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.700
And then we have the axioms which with the following axioms.

358
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:35.600
Okay.

359
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.300
the X seems are

360
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.000
addition and multiplication

361
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.000
vector addition

362
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.800
Factor multiplication, so let me pause pause over

363
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.200
 here and turn the abstract algebra in a

364
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.200
 moment. No one else. How do we differentiate the concept of row vector

365
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.600
 and column Vector using the notation?

366
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.100
I don't believe there's a notation for

367
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.400
expressing at least our letters

368
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.400
Unless of course you do something like, you

369
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.300
 know, you put a line break. You have like

370
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.400
 a long square bracket.

371
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:15.900
or you have a

372
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.700
like basically either

373
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.300
see write the sequence of numbers and sequence of

374
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.600
 components or scalars.

375
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.200
Horizontally and that becomes a row or you do it vertically

376
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.900
 you get a color.

377
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.500
But if you're looking at a letter and you want to know if this is a row

378
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.200
 or column you have to know from the from the context from the

379
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.600
 text surrounding it.

380
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.300
Okay, here we have it says that a vector space fee over

381
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:41.800
 the field.

382
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.000
What does over mean and what this field mean?

383
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:46.500
So let's

384
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.400
pause here. I'm gonna open another document to talk

385
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.900
 about abstract algebra a little bit.

386
00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.300
So this will be

387
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.600
abstract

388
00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.700
tutorial one

389
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:02.700
Okay.

390
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:03.900
so

391
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.400
I say this will take about 15 or so minutes.

392
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.700
But I mean if you if you do not have exposure to abstract algebra.

393
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.400
This would this is going to take you along. This will

394
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.000
 take you very far.

395
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.700
Later on when you I don't know.

396
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.400
Want to read more advanced probability or go into something called

397
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400
 The Measure Theory.

398
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.800
Knowledge of abstract algebra will be super beneficial.

399
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.500
 So let's begin.

400
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.900
The document is tutorial 7,

401
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.900
 which is also on the dashboard, okay?

402
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.000
I will begin with.

403
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.300
So number six the total number six.

404
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.900
on the dashboard

405
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.500
All right.

406
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.500
so you will begin with something called a

407
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.000
binary operation

408
00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:57.400
Okay.

409
00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.600
so this is

410
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.300
abstract

411
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.600
algebra tutorial

412
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.900
binary operation a binding operation

413
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.400
Is some sort of arithmetic operation that he can

414
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.200
 apply to the elements of a set.

415
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.400
For example addition and multiple equation are both examples

416
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.400
 of binary operations.

417
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.800
Okay, so let's establish this terminology

418
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.800
 binary operation.

419
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.500
and then we have

420
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.400
our first

421
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.500
special type of set an abstract algebra, which

422
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.100
 we call the group.

423
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.300
A group can we express?

424
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.000
as the Tuple and again Tuple is a set set curly,

425
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.100
 but it's

426
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.200
Okay, not pull it three

427
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.600
 elements. You would say a triple or three three people

428
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.300
 or four tubular five tuples. So however many elements you have in that

429
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.100
 set. You say number two pull.

430
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:04.900
Okay.

431
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.700
G is the set

432
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.400
and here the star indicates the bunny

433
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.400
 operation so can be multiplication or addition.

434
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.700
well, we don't we

435
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.900
if there are some certain rules.

436
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.700
We don't use the word it's quite vague. And these

437
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.900
 are the axioms that apply to the group

438
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.100
 group. By the way. The group is a foundation will build

439
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.700
 on top of so other types of sets and abstract algebra are

440
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.800
 variations of groups.

441
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.700
We first have something called closure.

442
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.600
What does closure mean?

443
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.700
Closure means that if you were to perform a binary operation on

444
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.900
 the elements of the set.

445
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.500
The outcome would be another element that also belongs

446
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.200
 to the set.

447
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.000
So let me actually change this to G.

448
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:08.600
Okay.

449
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.100
What's an example of?

450
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:11.500
such a

451
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.000
rule

452
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.600
the integers

453
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.200
if we take two integers or let's keep it

454
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.500
 simple if you take the natural numbers.

455
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.400
Add them together you will get another natural number.

456
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.100
So 5 plus 5 gives you 10 which isn't which is still an

457
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.800
 element within the natural numbers.

458
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.000
Multiply them you will also get another element.

459
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.100
but then division doesn't apply because if you divide

460
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.400
for example

461
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.400
4 over 5 the result is not going to be division. So that

462
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.200
 operation does not apply to that set.

463
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.000
Okay.

464
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.600
So there's closure then there's identity.

465
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.300
And identity says that there exists a number.

466
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.900
Such that when you multiply it.

467
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.100
By any of the elements in that set you get

468
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:02.900
 the element again.

469
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.200
So here what number could that be if you were

470
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:07.700
 talking about the

471
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.600
the integers

472
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.200
What number if we multiply it with

473
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.200
 any element would give us the same number. So for example, let's say a

474
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.700
 is 5.

475
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.600
A times what will give you five?

476
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:24.400
The number one. So here I stands for then and this

477
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.300
 is a unique element.

478
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.200
This is a unique element exactly. What?

479
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.700
So it the identity says that there

480
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.200
 exists a number such that multiply by an element of the

481
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.500
 set, you know, you get you get the same number and then there is inverse.

482
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.500
Okay.

483
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.900
We'll see an example of this but there's a number.

484
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.000
the

485
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.400
if you have a number and you multiply

486
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.200
 it by its inverse.

487
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.800
You will get the that unique identity identity element.

488
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.600
And then there's associativity.

489
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.800
It says that well, for example, if you're doing multiplication

490
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.400
 multiplying eight B times C

491
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.000
 and then multiplying it by a it is will give you the same.

492
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.400
Result if had you done 8 times B then

493
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.500
 times C this associate associated.

494
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.800
So abstract algebra.

495
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.200
When we have words like groups Rings Fields Etc

496
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.400
 such and I'm going to show you the others.

497
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.200
works this way

498
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.700
you have a set.

499
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.600
To which some specific actions apply

500
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.400
 and then if you add or remove axioms you

501
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.700
 then get another set. So for example, we have something called a billion group.

502
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:49.600
a billion group

503
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.600
a billion group. Does anyone know the synonym for the a billion

504
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:04.700
 group?

505
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.500
And you know anyone know.

506
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.100
there was

507
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.400
a problem with these synonyms. I mean exactly a commutative

508
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:16.500
 group.

509
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.600
commutative commutative

510
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.200
and what why is it called the commutative because

511
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.500
 we have axioms one to four plus a fifth.

512
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.700
Axiom

513
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.900
Which is commutative.

514
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.100
simply means if you multiply 8 times B is the same

515
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.500
 thing as multiplying B times a

516
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.600
Now, of course, we will come across certain sets in linear

517
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.800
 algebra where this is not the case.

518
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.300
because for example if you want to multiply a row by a matrix

519
00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.500
What am I saying? A vector multiplied by matrix? You

520
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.000
 cannot turn them around.

521
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.600
So what is it in if you want to multiply a

522
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.300
 vector with a matrix the number of columns must

523
00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.400
 match the number of rows.

524
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.500
So you can't just commit them around it's not

525
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.400
 the same thing. Okay.

526
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.600
But anyway, this is not specific to vectors and

527
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.500
 matrices is just

528
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.300
It can apply to different types of sets different types

529
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.300
 of mathematical objects.

530
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.000
And then we have a ring.

531
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.800
We just copy paste the whole.

532
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.700
Set of axioms.

533
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.100
You'll see what I'm going with this in a very shortly.

534
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.000
We haven't we have the ring.

535
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.900
A set to which the following actions apply you have associativity for

536
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:36.500
 addition.

537
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.600
Commutativity for addition there

538
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.800
 is a zero element.

539
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.400
So there's an element. This is incorrect.

540
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.800
 By the way plus 0 is a

541
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.800
A plus zero is it?

542
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.100
Okay.

543
00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.800
There is added inverse.

544
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.300
So similar to what we saw with the group, there's an element

545
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.500
 the inverse of which will give you.

546
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.700
That won't give us identity. This one gives us zero they

547
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.400
 cancel for here. In addition. They cancel each other out we of

548
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.300
 course have associativity. This is from multiplication. So associatively

549
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.600
 in committee commutativity for addition and the

550
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.100
 same for multiplication and then there's Unity

551
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.100
Like with groups and then there is the

552
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.700
 distributive law.

553
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.200
Then there is a special type of ring.

554
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.600
Called the integral domain.

555
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.100
And this is

556
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.100
 a set. It's the type of ring. It is a set. Of course.

557
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.500
 Well the axioms 128 but not seven.

558
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.500
So Unity does not apply to an integral domain.

559
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.600
Then there is the field. This is the word we encountered

560
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.700
 when we're talking about linear algebra.

561
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.500
So linear algebra.

562
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.000
Is a type of ring.

563
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.300
With axioms 1 to 8 that has all

564
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.300
 eight Axiom plus a ninth axis the

565
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.300
 multiplicative inverse.

566
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.900
That's what it field is.

567
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.100
Now, I really don't know where these names came from

568
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.300
 ring. I remember remember seeing a

569
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.200
 very fascinating page.

570
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.200
And there was illustration about it forming a ring.

571
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.900
 I don't remember unfortunately, but the

572
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.700
 names in my opinion, they're not very intuitive.

573
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.700
Like why field?

574
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.700
you know, it did not helpful but

575
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.500
That's how it is.

576
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.400
now

577
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.700
so I hope it's clear. What I feel is right a field is a set

578
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.700
 with

579
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.700
or I should say to which these rules apply.

580
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.300
That seems our rules. So this is the active

581
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.400
 means something that is true for all the elements

582
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.100
 of that set.

583
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.600
Okay, so to all of the elements in a ring,

584
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.200
 you can apply these rules. This is this is true

585
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.400
 why this is what why is why is even helpful because

586
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.400
 these axioms will help will

587
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.600
 give you confidence.

588
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.400
That whenever you apply such operations to any element of

589
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.200
 the set you can be sure.

590
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.200
It will it will hold?

591
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.700
If you're doing things like proofs or if you're from deleting

592
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.200
 a model axioms will really help you

593
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.200
 get to a solution faster. Anyway, that is

594
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.300
 so a fear. That's basically a ring, but we also have

595
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.800
 a ninth Axiom the multiplicative inverse.

596
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:39.500
so

597
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.000
we will see examples of vectors when

598
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.500
 you multiply by its inverse. You will

599
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.600
 get the original vector.

600
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.600
This is not something you can do to objects.

601
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.200
In the in the let's say integer number system.

602
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.200
Okay.

603
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.500
So let's return back to this.

604
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.500
Linear algebra tutorial so it says what a vector space V

605
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.100
 again the word space means set all

606
00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.000
 the field K with the following exam. So basically when

607
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.300
 we see over we mean the elements in this field are

608
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.200
 put in that set.

609
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.200
Okay, so we have

610
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.200
a vector addition

611
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.000
which means if you add

612
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.700
the elements in this set

613
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.100
They have two vectors now here. They don't use

614
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.900
 the arrow, but I'm going to use it because

615
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.500
it's very important that you

616
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.300
do so

617
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.500
Okay, so actually scalars.

618
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.200
So have you plus b in?

619
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.000
uppercase V

620
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.800
Yes, so we have two elements.

621
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.200
in a vector

622
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.500
the it's addition the addition of these two elements.

623
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.600
the addition of these two elements

624
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.300
would give you another component inside the vector.

625
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.200
And then there is more Vector multiplication.

626
00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.800
which is the same thing, but

627
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.100
multiplication

628
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:39.900
use times

629
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.100
and if we return to abstract algebra.

630
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.600
We set a field is a type of ring.

631
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.800
And I did not indicate it here, but even closure applies to

632
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.200
 to rings.

633
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.300
Okay.

634
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.000
So this is a wood will encounter a great deal.

635
00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.200
Let me now show you.

636
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.700
A linear combination what is linear combination?

637
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.300
linear combination

638
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.600
and let me talk about our

639
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.000
to the power n what does this mean?

640
00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.300
R to the power

641
00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.100
3

642
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.100
dollars

643
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.300
Does anyone know what this what this what this means? So for example,

644
00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.500
 if you have something like this?

645
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.200
let's say

646
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.300
to the power 3

647
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.200
What does this mean?

648
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.300
What could this mean?

649
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.100
any ideas

650
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.600
This is something you will see everywhere three

651
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.300
 dimensional space.

652
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.100
XYZ axis Yeah, so basically

653
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.400
you will get a set.

654
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.000
let's use the word space to be consistent with

655
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.000
 linear algebra terminology with

656
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.600
Any three letters?

657
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.300
Any three?

658
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.600
elements or components

659
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.800
or points since the one using XYZ any points

660
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.900
 all of which belong inside the real numbers system

661
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.800
 such that such that

662
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.400
A B C all of them are in

663
00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.600
r or the real number

664
00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:58.900
 system

665
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.900
Okay. So for example, this could be a point in

666
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.200
 a three-dimensional space.

667
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.900
Or it could just be a vector.

668
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.500
if you remember in

669
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.200
okay, maybe you're not all there, but it doesn't necessarily have

670
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.200
 to be a point on a coordinate space. It just

671
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.000
 could be a set with three elements in it.

672
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.500
So that's what this this means.

673
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.000
So for example art to the power 5 same thing a b c.

674
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.100
d

675
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.900
This should be our.

676
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.400
Okay, so here it says we have so now

677
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.000
 that we know what that is.

678
00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.200
the linear combination

679
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.500
a linear combination is let's say we have vectors.

680
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.600
And here I'm using the Bold errors V2 from V1 to

681
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.300
 VK, by the way when I see n or k or some

682
00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.100
 subscript like that either pick the number three or the number

683
00:36:59.100 --> 00:36:59.200
 five.

684
00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.100
Helps me visualize things. So let's say we have

685
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.800
 five vectors. This is a vector 1 2 3 4 5 all of

686
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.500
 them are for example three in three

687
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:08.800
 dimensions.

688
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.200
So this is a set with three points. This is a set with

689
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:12.700
 three points.

690
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.000
And even the fifth Vector is a set.

691
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.800
with three points or three

692
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.900
 components or three elements

693
00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:22.700
and

694
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.600
associate with each Vector was a constant.

695
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.200
Which are real numbers so we can see there's no

696
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.900
 superscript here because these are scalars.

697
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.000
So what's an example of a linear combination something that looks like this?

698
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:40.700
I will use.

699
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.000
The letter L.

700
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:45.900
So we will take

701
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.900
the vectors

702
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.200
I'll just do to I'll just do three.

703
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.500
two and three

704
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.000
Okay, but we're going to add that together.

705
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.700
but to each vector

706
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:15.400
we multiply the constants.

707
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.200
So Alpha sub 1 will be multiplied by the first

708
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:19.800
 vector.

709
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.500
And then here we have the second vector.

710
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.800
and of course the third Factor

711
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.600
evaluate this expression.

712
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.500
And you have your linear combination?

713
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.500
Now what's a linear span?

714
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.100
a linear span

715
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.000
is the following

716
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.600
Say we have a vector space.

717
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.000
Basically as a set of vectors A set

718
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.600
 containing vectors.

719
00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.200
And we have let's say five vectors.

720
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.000
five vectors

721
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.100
Let me keep of this.

722
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:22.500
Okay.

723
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.300
Then the linear span.

724
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.500
And let me copy this bit. Let me make sure I think I'm missing

725
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.800
 one letter. Let me double check this.

726
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.400
Make sure I got all the letters, right?

727
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:55.900
so we have

728
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.900
yeah, this was supposed to be X.

729
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:09.200
and

730
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.100
these are supposed to be

731
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.500
I was I meant to do this I made to make these bold to

732
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.100
 make these vectors.

733
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.800
Let me deliver quickly. It's just to be avoid any

734
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.100
 mistakes.

735
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:32.600
Yes, yes.

736
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.100
Okay.

737
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.400
Ron says given a vector space given given so

738
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.900
 a given.

739
00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.400
Given a vector space. I don't need to capitalize these words.

740
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.400
 I have to be careful with the

741
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.600
But how I spell?

742
00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.600
So we have a space.

743
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.400
a vector space V

744
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:04.800
what elements?

745
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.600
V1 V2 all the way to VK

746
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.500
and then we put these vectors inside a

747
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.400
 set called X.

748
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.300
Okay, so we take these sequence of values. So they're all

749
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.100
 vectors. We put them inside it says inside the set X.

750
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.600
If we apply this linear this linear span function

751
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.100
 to X.

752
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.300
Then we will get the following.

753
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.500
We will get a set of the linear

754
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.200
 combinations. So that's what a linear span is. A linear span is

755
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.100
 a set of linear combination if you remember from we talked

756
00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.300
 about self-brother notation.

757
00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.500
We said that.

758
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.600
A this is well, and

759
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.400
 this is a set.

760
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.400
with these elements

761
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.700
Well, actually this is not an element. This is an X. This is the evaluation of

762
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.100
 expression.

763
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.300
Such that these are

764
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:56.800
 vectors.

765
00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.700
And these are the constants.

766
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.900
So linear span is a set of linear

767
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.000
 combinations. So it's basically a set of these.

768
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.300
That's what a linear span is.

769
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.200
Okay.

770
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.300
Made a column space and roast

771
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.400
 space are quite simple. Why do we get a very close to Gilbert strengths

772
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.300
 for Big Ideas, right if you remember in

773
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.700
 session one I told you about

774
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.300
Gilbert strengths for fundamentals. There's a

775
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.100
 video on YouTube MIT course where we talked

776
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.300
 we starts discussion aligning algebra with these

777
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.200
 four special spaces these four special sets. They're

778
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.400
 all space the column space

779
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.200
 the null space and I think something called the

780
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.800
 left knelt space. I I need double check the fourth one.

781
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.100
But a matrix, you know a matrix, I mean, you

782
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.700
 know what it looks like.

783
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.500
We've already seen it.

784
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.300
matrices are denoted like

785
00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:57.600
 so

786
00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.200
so for example

787
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.800
to the power and

788
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.200
times that

789
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.800
so for vectors, we have raised

790
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.200
 to one particular power that will give us a sequence of

791
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.700
 an element so five elements in one set and a

792
00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.500
 matrix obviously is a set of sets.

793
00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.300
So it can be a set with five

794
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.100
 elements in three rows.

795
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.500
So what this could look something?

796
00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:33.200
like this

797
00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.100
but

798
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.100
small

799
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.100
Matrix

800
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.900
oh, let me just copy from the other tutorial.

801
00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.700
Where's the Matrix?

802
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.300
Here we go.

803
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.800
Now, this is a square Matrix. So let me make it.

804
00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.000
not Square

805
00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.500
So in matrices do we indicate the number of rows first or

806
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:20.700
 the number?

807
00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:21.100
of columns

808
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.200
I think this is something I always keep forgetting. So what would n be

809
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:26.300
 here?

810
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.700
What would NB here?

811
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.200
And what would M be?

812
00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.500
So n is the number of rows so we have two rows and three.

813
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.900
So that's what we mean by by.

814
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.900
you know R to the power n times m

815
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:46.800
two rows

816
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.000
with three columns

817
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.200
and I hope you can be you know, it's probably self-explanatory. What

818
00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.100
 a column space is. We said we've already established that

819
00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.300
 there was space being set.

820
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.400
So the column space for the Matrix, let's

821
00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.200
 indicate this Matrix with the letter m.

822
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.200
Okay. Once again, we want to make sure

823
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.600
 it's bold letter. So PF.

824
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.700
So the economic space of M would be what that sets of

825
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:18.500
 columns.

826
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.500
so it will get a vector 2 6 a vector 1/5

827
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.500
 of vector one negative 3

828
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.500
and then the row space would be well two one one and six five negative

829
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:27.600
 three.

830
00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:28.700
That's it.

831
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:32.200
That's all the row space and column space are.

832
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:43.900
So we would get this.

833
00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.100
So they're all space.

834
00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.500
So, this is our Matrix m.

835
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.400
I think this was for the null space. This is incorrect. I'll come back to this later

836
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.200
 on. They're all spaces the how can

837
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.900
 I do I'll make it? Okay, let me do this very quickly so we get

838
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.300
let's you set builder notation, right so we will get

839
00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.000
a set of vectors

840
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.400
such that.

841
00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.200
V

842
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.800
Is a column.

843
00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.000
It's color.

844
00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:58.800
of

845
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.800
the Matrix m

846
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.100
and of course, this is supposed to

847
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:13.200
 be real sorry and of course column space would be all of

848
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:13.300
 the

849
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.500
the sets that make up the row in in The

850
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:20.800
 Matrix sound.

851
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.200
Okay, so, oh we will use

852
00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.600
 this glossary.

853
00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.200
So that we can you know easily.

854
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.000
Talk about anything to with matrices neural networks.

855
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.200
3D plots

856
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.700
And every time we use words like this, we know what we're talking about.

857
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:47.800
All right.

858
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.300
So I think you most of you said you have

859
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.300
 let me just double check your answers. So yeah, when I asked if you all have

860
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.000
 no pandas installed.

861
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.200
Ron you said no. Okay run. I'll

862
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.400
 tell you where you can do this exercise.

863
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.100
You can there's an online compiler where you

864
00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:08.800
 can just write your code.

865
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.600
I think everybody else has Python and stuff again.

866
00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.100
 I'll give it here's what I'll do with the exercise. I'll give

867
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.200
 you I'll write the exercise.

868
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.300
If you can do it on your laptop on in your

869
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.300
 own ID, perfect. Otherwise, I'll give you a link to the online compiler. You

870
00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:22.900
 can do the solution there.

871
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:23.900
Okay.

872
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:29.900
comment in the chart

873
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.200
I have Python 3, that's fine. You don't

874
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.400
 need we don't we don't need you Jupiter notebook. We want just for comments not

875
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.900
 in comments to

876
00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.300
Because we're going to be using my numpy and math

877
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.600
 plot lib, and so you'll be writing.

878
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.100
Series of Snippets so it just makes

879
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.200
 it easier to see your code progress and

880
00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.600
 actually visualize it. So for now you don't we don't need it.

881
00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:57.700
Okay.

882
00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.600
For now, you don't need it.

883
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.700
Let me switch to the

884
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.500
slack Channel

885
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.200
to write the exercise.

886
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:10.200
Okay.

887
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:34.900
exercise

888
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.200
one

889
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.400
P exercise by the way, while I'm running this does

890
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.500
 it do any of you have any questions?

891
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:49.300
Because I've been talking 15 minutes straight 15 minutes straight without

892
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:52.200
 asking any quick with that leg asking questions.

893
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.200
 If you have any questions, let me know while I type the exercise.

894
00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:01.100
Hey Danny. Hey there Ron your example

895
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.600
 for the linear space.

896
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.900
The second term had subscripts of one for

897
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.000
 those supposed to be twos.

898
00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.200
and then your space

899
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.600
what I mean linear span, I'm sorry.

900
00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.200
about the bottom equation

901
00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:23.300
Yes.

902
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.900
Okay, okay. I see perfect. Thank you.

903
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.700
So this should be

904
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.800
to one video

905
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:42.400
Thanks.

906
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.100
And I should also make these gold. I'll fix that.

907
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.200
Okay, so for this one.

908
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.800
You want to create three?

909
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.600
vectors in Python

910
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.500
essentially a list or you can even use

911
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.300
two poles to do this

912
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.300
Create three vectors and python.

913
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:18.000
over

914
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.500
and I'm going to use linear algebra terminology.

915
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.100
are

916
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:31.300
Yeah.

917
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:38.500
to the power

918
00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:40.500
and where

919
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.000
n is equal to 5.

920
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:48.200
Okay.

921
00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.600
And call or declare.

922
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.300
these

923
00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:56.000
vectors

924
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:01.900
with

925
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.000
you know, we sub 1 V sub 2 V sub 3

926
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.900
so in Python, we use something called snake notation.

927
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.500
As opposed to camera case like notation is when you deliver

928
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:15.600
 it.

929
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:19.700
characters or variable or even functions with underscore instead

930
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:19.900
 of

931
00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:22.600
complicating them

932
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:32.300
put the vectors.

933
00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.900
V sub 1 V sub 2 V sub 3

934
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.400
oops

935
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.600
inside the Matrix

936
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:56.300
math PF

937
00:52:58.900 --> 00:52:59.100
M.

938
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.300
and this would be

939
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.200
so we have

940
00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.600
Each Vector has five.

941
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.100
Components and we have three vectors. So that's three.

942
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.700
times five

943
00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.800
and you want to declare this Matrix?

944
00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.000
declare

945
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.700
let's Matrix.

946
00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:31.000
with

947
00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.600
See, here's the problem in Python. We use uppercase letters

948
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.000
 for classes.

949
00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:37.700
not

950
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.400
yeah, we don't use uppercase that is because it meant for classes, but

951
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.800
and well, let's take the lower class big lower

952
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.700
 clusters because we cannot violate Python Programming conventions.

953
00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.100
and then for number three

954
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.400
convert

955
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:04.800
the

956
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:07.100
Matrix

957
00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.400
to a numpy

958
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:15.500
Array, how do you do this using the code?

959
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.400
NP dot array

960
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:22.900
the method

961
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.500
so there's a difference you but you cannot you cannot perform.

962
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.300
Matrix operations on python lists

963
00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:35.300
 not unless you you write a function to implement them,

964
00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.100
 but you can do this with a numpy array. So if you

965
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.500
 have two numpy arrays, you can add them as if they were two vectors. I mean,

966
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.500
 that's what the library is built for.

967
00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.100
and then finally

968
00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.200
add the

969
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:52.900
elements

970
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.900
of the row space

971
00:54:59.600 --> 00:54:59.900
of

972
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:01.700
M.

973
00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.500
Remember the word space.

974
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:06.600
means set

975
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:11.000
so we're talking about the set of elements.

976
00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:12.500
So if

977
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.800
It's a space of a matrix then the

978
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.900
 elements of a matrix could only the row space

979
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.800
 of a matrix can only be three vectors.

980
00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.400
So I might suggestion is

981
00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:28.500
 see if we can do the first two. I just want to see if everybody's clear

982
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.400
 on the terminology so far and then you can attempt to

983
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:31.900
 do three and four.

984
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.700
Okay, let me add a note here.

985
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.400
For number three, you need to import.

986
00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.600
Numpy and you can do this.

987
00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.800
With this code so it would go import.

988
00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.800
NP and numpy as MP

989
00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:53.400
Okay.

990
00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.900
so I'll

991
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:00.400
take a screenshot of this exercise. I'll put this on

992
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:00.700
 Slack.

993
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.400
And I'll give you the link to the python interpreter.

994
00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.200
So this is

995
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.000
exercise

996
00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:15.100
one

997
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.300
see the screenshot.

998
00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.900
Alright, here's the picture.

999
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.800
Solve the or complete the steps.

1000
00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.300
steps in the exercise

1001
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.200
and then please submit your file.

1002
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.600
What you want to name exercise?

1003
00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:53.200
- 1.py to me privately, so don't post it

1004
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:53.700
 in the main Channel.

1005
00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:55.600
Okay.

1006
00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.400
let me tell you where you can do the exercise if

1007
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:00.600
 you don't have

1008
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.100
Notebooking The Notebook install

1009
00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.000
 because you also need the pandas library, right? They're not my library.

1010
00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.000
So

1011
00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.900
you could use call app which is both a notebook and it already has numpy pre-installed.

1012
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.600
so you can if you

1013
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.400
don't

1014
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.400
have

1015
00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:24.200
either numpy

1016
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.100
or Jupiter installed

1017
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.300
you can use Google call that which is free.

1018
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.600
 You don't even have to create an account.

1019
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.900
Pretty straightfor you go to collab.

1020
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.300
The link I just gave you.

1021
00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.100
You choose new notebook.

1022
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.400
new notebook

1023
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.900
and then you can use the code. I just showed you.

1024
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:00.700
So we'll come over here.

1025
00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.400
And then you would go.

1026
00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.000
import numpy

1027
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.200
as NP and then can carry on. So

1028
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.500
 for example if you want to create an array.

1029
00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:17.100
And not pyre you would go and pay array and then you would

1030
00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:17.600
 put your list.

1031
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:19.500
And just like that.

1032
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.200
We need to make sure we run this right?

1033
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.900
And just like that you have created yourself a vector.

1034
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:39.200
Okay, this would be for example Visa 1.

1035
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:43.900
So let's find out.

1036
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.100
10 minutes on this exercise

1037
00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:51.600
and then we'll look at the solution together. By the way for next

1038
00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.400
 session. What I'll do is in the dashboard. I'm going

1039
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:54.800
 to add.

1040
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.800
a web page a document

1041
00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:07.000
in with instructions on setting up pythons setting up

1042
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:10.300
 Jupiter notebook setting up vs code. I recommend use vs code.

1043
00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.200
Excuse me use vs code if you're doing this locally.

1044
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.400
and of course how to install these libraries

1045
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:20.200
there are two ways to start you put a notebook. One

1046
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.300
 of them is to install a separately install the server separately.

1047
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.500
Then there's a plugin vs code, which you just click

1048
00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:28.800
 on install and it's there.

1049
00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.300
Okay, so what we'll do that in the next session, but you definitely

1050
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:35.200
 want to do this because we are gonna like I said, this course is based

1051
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.200
 on Python and the numpy library. So you want to make sure you have already

1052
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.400
before Friday's session. Okay everybody.

1053
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.500
 So here's the exercise.

1054
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:48.200
10 minutes I will look at this. We'll look at the solution together

1055
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.700
 and let me also give you the glory for reference.

1056
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:52.400
I'll generate it here.

1057
00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:58.600
You know just second.

1058
01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.700
Here's the glossary for your reference.

1059
01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.600
See this PF.

1060
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.100
here

1061
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.300
you

1062
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.200
So do you want to see this solution or do you want more time? If you

1063
01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.200
 want to see the solution type in s if you want more time

1064
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:23.900
 type in t?

1065
01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:35.900
Anybody else?

1066
01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.900
Okay, so four more minutes for more minutes, I will look at the solution.

1067
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.100
I'll be with you in one second.

1068
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.800
Hi Richard, if you want to submit the file.

1069
01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.500
Just click on my name.

1070
01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.600
And then send message.

1071
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.100
So I can't I don't think I can send myself a message,

1072
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.400
 but just click on my icon my profile.

1073
01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.300
And then you'll have the option to send me direct message and then attach the

1074
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.200
 file attach your solution file.

1075
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:00.700
and by the way

1076
01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:06.000
I have to download the notebooks re-upload them. So I'll give

1077
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.300
feedback on the exercises after the session

1078
01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.100
 is over just faster fine.

1079
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.500
Do it that way.

1080
01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:14.500
Okay.

1081
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.100
mark

1082
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.100
So, thank you Rich for the file.

1083
01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:20.700
so, um

1084
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:22.800
is it better to

1085
01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.100
upload P Wi-Fi files or the or that

1086
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.300
 you put a notebook file? Oh nice. Okay.

1087
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.700
 The notebook is fine. All right, but yeah, I'll

1088
01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:36.300
 give feedback after the session is over so

1089
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:37.600
 at common

1090
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.300
Okay, should we look at the solution now?

1091
01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:56.100
If I can ask everyone to send in your

1092
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:56.500
 files.

1093
01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.300
so even if you're not done with the

1094
01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.000
 solution

1095
01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.300
It helps me see the solution be helps me to see you

1096
01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.400
 know, what part wasn't clear and then so I can emphasize on

1097
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.700
 it either in the next session or by maybe recording

1098
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.300
 separate videos. So please everybody if you haven't sent in

1099
01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.100
 your files send them now.

1100
01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.700
It's very important Cuba Lawrie. Neela.

1101
01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:23.600
Private if you haven't if anyone ran Richard.

1102
01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.300
If you haven't said in your face, please do so now.

1103
01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.100
I just said what whatever you have.

1104
01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.800
Just dump it dump it in the stock Channel.

1105
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.500
Let's get the solution together.

1106
01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.900
Okay, I will go to collab.

1107
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.400
And let's do this solution.

1108
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:44.400
Okay.

1109
01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:47.600
so I'm going to

1110
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.100
But the side by side so we can see the requirements.

1111
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.700
And the code next to each other.

1112
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:02.700
Yes.

1113
01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.300
Please everybody do send your files because that you know,

1114
01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:12.100
 it will help make the subsequent sessions more

1115
01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.500
 effective.

1116
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.100
Okay.

1117
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.400
So here we have numpy imported which means we can

1118
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:20.600
 use.

1119
01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.100
We can work with.

1120
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.300
A vectors and multi-dimensional arrays. So right now we're

1121
01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.300
 looking we will look at the NP dot array. There's something called NP in

1122
01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.700
 the array.

1123
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.200
The numpy library is quite

1124
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.900
 comprehensive. So we're going to go through

1125
01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:40.800
 it go through its different features.

1126
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:43.800
You know.

1127
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:45.500
and in each session

1128
01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.200
So here it says number one create three vectors.

1129
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.700
over RN

1130
01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.800
Where n is equal to 5.

1131
01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.600
so 5 dimensional vectors

1132
01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.100
and declare these with v sub 1 V sub 2 V sub

1133
01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:04.200
 3

1134
01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.500
So what would V sub 1 look like it would have V sub 1?

1135
01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.700
And this would be equal to I'm just going to put any five

1136
01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.000
 networks. I'm going to go one two.

1137
01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.300
three four five

1138
01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.500
okay, so this

1139
01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.900
Is all real numbers remember the set

1140
01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.600
 of natural numbers are subset

1141
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.800
 of the set of real numbers.

1142
01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.800
So these are all.

1143
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:34.900
Well, that's that's an example of one vector.

1144
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.100
over RN

1145
01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.400
and then V2 could be.

1146
01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:45.700
Seven eight nine.

1147
01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:50.300
ten seven eight nine Tenors going up any ground

1148
01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.300
 increments of one no particular reason for me to use these numbers just

1149
01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:55.200
Any random number will do.

1150
01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.500
And then we have V3.

1151
01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.300
so 12 13

1152
01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:01.900
14

1153
01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.200
15 16. There we go.

1154
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:08.500
So that's how we create.

1155
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:09.600
three

1156
01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:11.100
vectors

1157
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.300
and this is for number two put the vectors inside the

1158
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:20.700
 Matrix m.

1159
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.700
That is a three by three by five Matrix. How do

1160
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.800
 we create a matrix that has three file three by five?

1161
01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.200
So if you want to create a matrix.

1162
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.700
Yeah, that's again. Just a multi-dimensionalistant python.

1163
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.500
so what I'm just going to do is I'm going to remember a

1164
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.100
 matrix is a

1165
01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:43.100
is a is rows of vectors A

1166
01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.300
 Matrix is a rows of vectors. That's one

1167
01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.700
 way to look at it either Columns of rows.

1168
01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.200
Columns of vectors or rows of vectors here we

1169
01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:51.200
 have

1170
01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.300
we'll go with rows. So this is row number one.

1171
01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.600
Which is a vector?

1172
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.000
so these are all subsets of

1173
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.400
the row space of them

1174
01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:05.800
Okay, so V2.

1175
01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.700
And then V 3.

1176
01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:17.000
And now we have ourselves a matrix if I now type in m.

1177
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.300
There you can see.

1178
01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.800
if you use a math lab this

1179
01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:30.000
I mean the coding approach would be very

1180
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.500
 familiar.

1181
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.100
Oh, by the way, if you want to work with math lab discourse will help

1182
01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:37.300
 you out a great deal. Maybe I can

1183
01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.300
 I'll add I'll add Snippets.

1184
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.100
For master so we won't cover Matlab in the course, but I'll give you

1185
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:46.200
 the Matlab implementation of the Python code that

1186
01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:46.400
 we're doing.

1187
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:50.800
Matter, of course stands for Matrix laboratory if I

1188
01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.300
 remember correctly.

1189
01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:55.000
Anyway, so now we have a matrix which is a

1190
01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:58.900
 set of three subsets of three elements where

1191
01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.200
 each element is itself a vector.

1192
01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.700
So that's element 1 element 2 element 3. How do

1193
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.200
 we turn this thing into an array

1194
01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.100
 we go NP dot array.

1195
01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.600
And then you plug in your list.

1196
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.400
I'm gonna go ahead and put

1197
01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:16.900
m in there

1198
01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:21.100
Now, of course I could have made these numpy erased first and then

1199
01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:24.000
 put them in but the order doesn't matter not Pi will take care of it.

1200
01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.400
So let me add some comments in here. We will declare.

1201
01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:29.800
three vectors

1202
01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.500
over r

1203
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:34.800
3

1204
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.200
and then declare the Matrix m

1205
01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.000
which is

1206
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:46.500
2 by 3

1207
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.100
and then here I'm just previewing The Matrix preview The Matrix.

1208
01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:00.800
Okay.

1209
01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.900
Oh, excuse me, three by five.

1210
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.400
Yes 3.5.

1211
01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:08.700
Okay. Yeah three rows.

1212
01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.000
of elements for each element is a

1213
01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:15.100
space of five components or

1214
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.600
 five elements

1215
01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.300
And then here we are going to convert The

1216
01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:19.900
 Matrix.

1217
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:23.700
M.

1218
01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800
M to

1219
01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:28.900
a numpy

1220
01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.700
multi-dimensional

1221
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.900
multi-dimensional

1222
01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.700
well, that's actually not malt. It's actually affect It's actually an array

1223
01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:38.300
 with three elements. So

1224
01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.300
an Empire rate

1225
01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.700
now, how do we get the

1226
01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.800
first element of the row space of them

1227
01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:53.200
Run us. Can I assume there's an NP method to do

1228
01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.400
 step 4 there are but I'm gonna keep it simple. So for example if

1229
01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.100
 I want the first row.

1230
01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.800
I'm just going to go and

1231
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:03.800
zero, it's gonna give me the first Vector inside

1232
01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.500
 the Matrix.

1233
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:06.100
M.

1234
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.200
Okay, and then exactly I can use I

1235
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.300
 can use square bracket notation. If I want to add these three vectors together for

1236
01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:16.600
 four number step number four. So add

1237
01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.500
 the elements of the row space. What are the elements of the of

1238
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.000
 the row space?

1239
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:23.300
They are M sub M 0 and 1 and M2.

1240
01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:27.500
And here's the thing in programming we start our

1241
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:29.300
 subscripts from zero so we come from 0.

1242
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.600
So this would be the first Vector second Vector third vector.

1243
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:39.100
and then if you want to add them together, well, we just do just not biologically

1244
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.000
 add them together like so

1245
01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.300
and we can call this the what should

1246
01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:46.700
 we call this?

1247
01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.300
This will be V sub 4 remember what

1248
01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.700
 we said about the vector space we said.

1249
01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:55.700
It is addition.

1250
01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.300
The close reaction applies to it under

1251
01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:05.400
 addition. So if you add the if you

1252
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:09.000
 add two vectors together, you get a third Vector. That's what closures and

1253
01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.700
 you will see now if I add these together

1254
01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.100
And I say V sub 4.

1255
01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.000
V sub 4

1256
01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:20.700
why is it stuck?

1257
01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:26.900
That was not supposed to happen. Why why let's see.

1258
01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.000
What are you wrong?

1259
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.500
these sub4

1260
01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.900
the numpy in the area overrides the plus operator. Is

1261
01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.200
 that a question or is that a statement?

1262
01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:47.800
Iran

1263
01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:52.700
No, no, I did. I just did the solution. I literally the

1264
01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:53.200
 solution before I

1265
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.500
started this

1266
01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.200
what am I doing wrong?

1267
01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:10.300
Oh, okay. So yes, the question is yes, it does.

1268
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:14.200
let me see why I'm getting a combination of

1269
01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:15.600
lists

1270
01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:21.200
Maybe I missed a code and here. Ah, yes. They just

1271
01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.200
 made a mistake. I did convert.

1272
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.400
I did convert M to a numpy array, but

1273
01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:30.500
 I did not reassign it so I'm gonna reassign it. Okay, so m

1274
01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:33.400
 is gonna go from being a python listen to now being a

1275
01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.200
 numpy array. Okay. I was missing this bit. So one

1276
01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:36.700
 more time.

1277
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.200
Now I'm going to create a fourth Vector out of the sum of

1278
01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.900
 these vectors. And if I now say V4 there you

1279
01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.600
 can see we've done.

1280
01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.400
vector addition

1281
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.400
and that's

1282
01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:53.700
 the answer.

1283
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.200
now, this is very nice because

1284
01:22:58.100 --> 01:22:58.700
we can go.

1285
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.900
Almost seamlessly from math expression to python

1286
01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.400
 implementation. And then later on when we

1287
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:10.200
 look at examples of you know, graphing vectors and three-dimensional

1288
01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.500
 space.

1289
01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.400
And one of the things I really want to show you is cosine similarity.

1290
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.500
this little

1291
01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.100
function

1292
01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:23.000
is so useful if you want to let's say if you're doing

1293
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:23.300
 text.

1294
01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.600
natural language processing

1295
01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:26.600
or

1296
01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:32.400
you know how when you know how when you Google a term in in

1297
01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.500
 Google?

1298
01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:34.300
and then

1299
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.000
you you misspell the word.

1300
01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:41.700
So Google gives you a suggest award.

1301
01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:44.600
 It is very close. So let's say I type in the word Apple, but I

1302
01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.100
 type APLE

1303
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.100
And the Google Source did you mean Apple?

1304
01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.400
It does that.

1305
01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:53.400
so one way to to see how

1306
01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.400
or to find a close approximate for

1307
01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.000
 the user's query is to use cosine similarity.

1308
01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:03.900
And it uses one part of one

1309
01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:06.600
 one of the components maybe not

1310
01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.200
 use that word because now we talk about linear algebra. One of

1311
01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.700
 the pieces of this cosine similarity is the magnitude of the

1312
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.200
Of the vector, which I'm going to show in a second, but this is the solution

1313
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:20.400
 is the solution clear. First of all before I show you the solution to this.

1314
01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.600
Before I show you the magnitude very quickly.

1315
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.200
Is it clear?

1316
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.100
So now you're adding.

1317
01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.000
declare

1318
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.600
declare a fourth vector.

1319
01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.300
That is the sum.

1320
01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:40.800
of vectors

1321
01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:43.700
one two three

1322
01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.600
if it's clear type in C.

1323
01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.100
Otherwise, let me know if you have any questions.

1324
01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.500
previously the answer

1325
01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.600
No, if the answer is clear if you understood the code type. Oh,

1326
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.200
 no, it's I now can see it now one more thing.

1327
01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.700
I can understand that maybe the linearity part

1328
01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.300
 would be easy but maybe for the program meaning you need some practice.

1329
01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:19.800
 What I'm going to do is I'm also going to attach a Python tutorial

1330
01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.200
 from the

1331
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:24.000
From the other course, it's very short. I think.

1332
01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:29.000
In about 30 minutes, I go over data structures

1333
01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:31.900
 in Python. So there's one very basic

1334
01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:34.000
 tutorial that starts from the very

1335
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.800
 like from scratch like print function.

1336
01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:40.300
But like really basics of python and then

1337
01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:43.400
 there is one more comprehensive one that goes into the daily structures.

1338
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.400
I'll attach both of the dashboard. So maybe

1339
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.200
it might it will help you if you review those. So if you if you

1340
01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.300
 know, you kind of have to work your way around this code watch those

1341
01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.600
 videos and hopefully you be

1342
01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.200
Prepared for this next Workshop. Anyway, let me download this so

1343
01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.000
 this is the solution to

1344
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.600
exercise one solution

1345
01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.300
to exercise one

1346
01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.600
file download

1347
01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:10.400
py

1348
01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.100
here we go solution to

1349
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:23.200
exercise

1350
01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:24.500
one

1351
01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:29.800
Okay.

1352
01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.000
the only three minutes left, so let me talk about let me quickly show you the

1353
01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:36.900
 magnitude thing and then

1354
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.000
we'll talk about what we'll do for the next session.

1355
01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:45.100
so coming back here to

1356
01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.300
our tutorial

1357
01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.000
magnitude is pretty straightforward.

1358
01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:56.100
you

1359
01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:05.800
Say you have a vector.

1360
01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.800
We have a given a vector.

1361
01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.800
I'm just gonna call this V.

1362
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.500
I can mold.

1363
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:21.400
with

1364
01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:23.700
four elements

1365
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.100
one five three

1366
01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.300
two just random numbers

1367
01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:30.600
then the magnitude

1368
01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.100
the magnet

1369
01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.400
ude of the

1370
01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:37.300
vector

1371
01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:39.000
is denoted

1372
01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:42.400
as follows

1373
01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.700
so it's just two vertical bars.

1374
01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:51.000
And how do you evaluate it? We take the square root.

1375
01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.500
of all the elements of this

1376
01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:00.300
of all the elements components points again. These words are

1377
01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:03.900
 interchangeable of the set V. So we have how many

1378
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:06.600
 components we have four components in here. So

1379
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.900
 we will Square all of them.

1380
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.000
Add them all up.

1381
01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.400
take the square root of

1382
01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.400
whatever this expression evaluates to and that gives

1383
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.100
 us the magnitude.

1384
01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:30.400
With respect to cosine similarity. There's of course

1385
01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:34.300
 the cosine function. I will add some reading

1386
01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:34.900
 materials some

1387
01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.600
review material for trigonometry

1388
01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:43.900
now one of the really what

1389
01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.100
 I found helpful with trigonometry remembering

1390
01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.000
What sign is what cosine is is not that?

1391
01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.500
That mnemonic, you know so Kato, I don't like mnemonics. I

1392
01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:56.300
 like to know why why is side cold side.

1393
01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:59.300
 First of all of all these words that one can use why sign?

1394
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.600
so this is the wood side particular in particular has a

1395
01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.300
interesting history

1396
01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:11.400
The word has got has been let's say

1397
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:11.900
 butchered.

1398
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.500
It actually has been b*******. It has gone from

1399
01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:18.200
it one particular word in Indian it then it

1400
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.400
 has been mistranslated to

1401
01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.100
Arabic

1402
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.400
or it was correctly translated Arabic but miss translated to Latin.

1403
01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:31.500
And we are here. We are here where we have these words like sign

1404
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.300
 cosine and these words don't have any intuitive meaning

1405
01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:35.200
 but I'll I'll

1406
01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:37.700
others a separate material

1407
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.200
Ron ask is there an indeed in the

1408
01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.300
 array method for magnitude?

1409
01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:47.600
Yes, I don't remember the method though one by

1410
01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.800
 the way, one of the helpful things you can do with a something

1411
01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.400
 like colab or vs code, which I'll tell

1412
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.200
 you how to install it. By the way is if you hit the button.

1413
01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:00.600
Yeah, the all of the methods that apply

1414
01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.700
 to a numpy object will appear here.

1415
01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.800
so for magnitude

1416
01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.200
I don't remember I'd have to

1417
01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:10.500
 look it up.

1418
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:14.500
By the way, I have to look at reference code when I do these exactly there's

1419
01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.300
 no way I can remember everything.

1420
01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.300
Here, so there is the mean if you want to Value the mean the

1421
01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:20.500
 maximum minimum values.

1422
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.100
I can flatten it. So if you want to go from if you want to

1423
01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:26.300
 transform from a matrix to a vector you can do it.

1424
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:32.100
Magnitude. Okay. So let me just say magnitude.

1425
01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.200
a vector in numpy

1426
01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.400
directly from the

1427
01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:46.100
See ideally you should see this from the numpy.

1428
01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:58.100
It's an attribute.

1429
01:30:58.800 --> 01:30:59.500
or a method

1430
01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:05.600
Anyway, I'll have to look it up. I'll look it up. And anyway,

1431
01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.100
 we'll look at the examples. Yeah, I tried

1432
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:08.500
 Norm.

1433
01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:14.300
And before is this a list or is it a python? Is

1434
01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:16.000
 it? No, it's it's a numpy array.

1435
01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.700
Anyway, we'll look at examples of this.

1436
01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.600
I look it up normally.

1437
01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:31.800
Okay, maybe it's actually NP dot Norm.

1438
01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.800
And then V4. Maybe it's supposed to be that way.

1439
01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.100
Beautiful. It's not even that.

1440
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.800
I'll look it up. Okay everybody.

1441
01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:47.300
The the first assignment will be posted on dashboard.

1442
01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.200
So the the recording from

1443
01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:54.500
 Session 1 this recording the tutorials are we

1444
01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.600
 just looked at obviously, there's a tutorial for abstract algebra,

1445
01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.300
 which is the what we talked about today. So just

1446
01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:03.200
 keep in mind now the assignments will be due.

1447
01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:07.500
In the subsequent model so assignments from module one

1448
01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:08.600
 will be doing module 2.

1449
01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.400
assignments for module 2 with the do

1450
01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:16.300
when module 3 so when the third week starts, okay. Just keep

1451
01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:16.900
 that in mind, please.

1452
01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.300
And as if you have any if you have any questions about

1453
01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:22.100
 what we covered or subsequent classes.

1454
01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:25.100
Do let me know on stock.

1455
01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.500
Yeah, you know what? I'll check this out and I'll add other

1456
01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.800
 comment here comment here commenting here. Okay. Thank you.

1457
01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.300
 Everybody. Enjoy the rest of your day, and I hope to see you on

1458
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:34.700
 Friday.

1459
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:36.800
For now. Take care. Bye.
