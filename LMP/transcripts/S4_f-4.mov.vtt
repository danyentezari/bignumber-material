00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.200
with gaussian elimination

1
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.300
That's what we're going to talk about now.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.500
gaussian elimination

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.300
we can use these Matrix we can use.

4
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.800
one row

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.500
to either

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.700
and we usually would eliminate okay to when you get your

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.500
 Matrix in reduced row Echelon form

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.700
 you have eliminated the rows.

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.500
To eliminate means well again you have leading ones

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.100
 on you have ones on the principal diagonal zeros.

11
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.200
below the principal Diagon

12
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.800
so in order for us to eliminate

13
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.300
these rows we can use them against each other.

14
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.100
So, for example, I can take row number two.

15
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.000
Subtract it from row number one or vice versa,

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.700
 or I can multiply one of these rows

17
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.400
 by some other number.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.200
and then

19
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.200
that rule

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.700
Whose values have now become multiples of some other number I

21
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.500
 can subtract from the first row.

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.700
This one should be difficult to do so for example and just

23
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.100
 again for notational convenience.

24
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.200
 I'm going to lose.

25
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.000
That 10 to the power 4 and I

26
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.500
 hope you're okay with that. I'm just gonna lose that because you know the separate the

27
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.700
 notation.

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.800
the easier will be for us to

29
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.500
keep track of what's going on.

30
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.500
and I'm going to lose this parenthesis really get

31
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.700
all that clutter out of the way.

32
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800
So again, I want this to be a leading one.

33
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.400
And you know what just to simplify

34
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 this so we don't spend too much time. I'm going to reorder these and that's

35
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.800
 perfectly fine. The that's within

36
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.500
 Gauss and elimination. You can swap rows.

37
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.200
 Okay. Anyway, I what I've done is I've now

38
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.800
 swapped.

39
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.300
the rules in fact to denote this

40
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.000
we would do we would say this r

41
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.900
sub 2

42
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.300
and then a right arrow.

43
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400
R sub 1

44
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.600
That means R2 has been replaced with R1.

45
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.600
now in your opinion

46
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.000
How can I

47
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200
Get this to be reduced.

48
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600
Assume this was two.

49
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.800
This was one and this was one and one.

50
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.700
What would we have to do to reduce this to

51
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.300
 eliminate this role?

52
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.800
Well, I would say we would subtract Row 2

53
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.400
 from Row 1.

54
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.200
so the difference of this row and

55
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200
 that row and then the

56
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.600
Result of that difference. I would put back into Row

57
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.800
 1.

58
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.200
Let me show you what I mean. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to subtract Row

59
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.300
 2 from Row 1.

60
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.700
and the order is important right because

61
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.300
If I subtract 200 minus 100, I'll get

62
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.200
 a positive number. Whereas I'll get

63
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.300
 a negative number the other that we round so I'm going to subtract row two from Row

64
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.500
 1

65
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.300
and then I'm going to take this evaluation.

66
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.400
This result and replace it with the Row 1 so

67
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.100
 I will get something that looks like this.

68
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.500
This becomes 100.

69
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.200
So 200 minus 100 gives you

70
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.800
 100.

71
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.400
Minus 100 this is gonna give me zero.

72
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.200
And then 4,000 minus 3,000 that's

73
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
 gonna give me one thousand.

74
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.900
There we go. So I have 100 up

75
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.000
 here.

76
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400
Now I need to get this.

77
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.300
To be a zero.

78
00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.300
Okay.

79
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.800
We're doing gaussian elimination.

80
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.800
Now, let's see how I can get rid of that. I can subtract. Well, well

81
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.200
 100 minus 100 and this will this

82
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.800
I will subtract.

83
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.600
This Row from that row and

84
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.400
 then the result.

85
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.400
I will plug it inside Row 1.

86
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.400
But if I subtract this from that I'm going to get in. I'm

87
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.200
 going to get a negative 2,000. I don't want negative 2000 so I'll do

88
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.500
 roll one minus row two, so I'm going

89
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.700
 to go.

90
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.200
Row 1

91
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.300
minus Row 2

92
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.300
and then whatever the evaluates to I'm going to plug that into Row

93
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.400
 1.

94
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.800
So we will get something that looks like this.

95
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.500
Okay, 100 minus 100. That's just

96
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.700
 zero.

97
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.700
100 minus 100 that will stay 100

98
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.700
and then 3000 minus 1,000 that

99
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.500
 gives us 2,000.

100
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.900
Look at that.

101
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.400
now we have

102
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.500
upper triangle

103
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.000
The last thing I need to do is get these to be once.

104
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.600
And what I will do is I will multiply this by

105
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.800
 one over 100.

106
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.400
So I'll cancel them out.

107
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.100
So to denote that.

108
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.300
step

109
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.300
I'm going to say.

110
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.500
I'm going to say.

111
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.100
that I will multiply

112
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.600
I will multiply.

113
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.700
all the numbers on Row 1 with 1 over

114
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.100
100

115
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.000
and then

116
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.100
I'm going to

117
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.400
replace Row 1

118
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.800
with the result of this

119
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.100
calculation right arrow

120
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.100
so that will do what it will give me.

121
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.300
100 over 100

122
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.500
100 over 100. That's just one.

123
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.200
Zero over 100. That's just zero and then 1,000 over

124
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.600
 100 is just 10.

125
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.200
And then I'm going to do the same thing for row number two, so I'm going to copy this

126
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.600
 bit.

127
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.500
Okay.

128
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.500
I'm gonna do the same thing for row number

129
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.600
 two.

130
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.800
Okay.

131
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.900
multiply these values

132
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.700
with one over 100

133
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.400
and then this is what's going to happen.

134
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.300
So 0 over 100 this is going to be zero.

135
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.000
That's going to be 1.

136
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.200
And then 2,000 over 100 is going to be 20.

137
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.100
And of course, I hope you can see the solution. It's with managed

138
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.400
 to do it if I

139
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.400
Put back.

140
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:20.800
the

141
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.200
You know.

142
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.800
times 10 to the power 4

143
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.600
Well, we'll get this Matrix.

144
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.800
This one sorry but 10 to the power 4.

145
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.500
times 10 to the power 4

146
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.300
times 10

147
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.400
to the power 4

148
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.400
This is exactly what we had seen in our

149
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:47.700
 last session.

150
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.500
Right. So what is this if we plug in

151
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.700
 these values back into the

152
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.700
Inequalities we had this would give us or

153
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.200
 after we turned ecology the equations we would

154
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.500
 get One X.

155
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.000
plus 0 y equals 10

156
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.300
times

157
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.200
10 to the power 4 which is 10 million.

158
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.900
And then for the one below.

159
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.800
the one below this would become zero X

160
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.900
1 y

161
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.300
20

162
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.400
times 10 to the power 4

163
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.200
and of course if we get rid of these zeros, I'm only putting the

164
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.300
 leading one just so you can see how I imply like

165
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.300
 what I'm plugging these numbers.

166
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.500
but in algebra, of course, we don't actually put

167
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.300
one

168
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.900
we don't put the coefficient one.

169
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.900
That because that that's implied it's there. So the

170
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.800
 one goes away.

171
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.200
0 y That's Just well, that's nothing

172
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.800
 that goes away.

173
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.800
And here down here zero X so the

174
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.500
 X goes away.

175
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.200
And then one y we don't actually need to put the Y we don't need to

176
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.500
 put the one and there we go. That's exactly what we have. This is the this was

177
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.800
 the the point on the feasible region.

178
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:14.800
so

179
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.200
we looked at we have now seen two ways of solving our system

180
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.500
 inequalities one was.

181
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.000
with the

182
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.800
Classical algebra and now we've used Gauss elimination

183
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.200
 from linear algebra.

184
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.000
now

185
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.000
In my opinion, this is still time consuming right? I

186
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.200
 do think

187
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.000
 would you say this is simpler than

188
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.600
the algebraic manipulation we saw

189
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.500
in our last session or easier.

190
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.400
so gaussian elimination versus

191
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.400
Classical object which one do you think is easier?

192
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.200
There Was the Same

193
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:01.900
I suppose.

194
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.200
I would say however if you're doing multiple inequalities, your

195
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.100
 gaussian will will be more will

196
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.700
 be a lot faster.

197
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.300
Which is more organized I agree because you don't have to move things

198
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.500
 to the left to the right.

199
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.400
Well, yeah.

200
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.000
I think with some practice you might find.

201
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.200
Galaxy elimination furthermore. Here's another

202
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.400
 thing.

203
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.500
You probably won't do this by hand in real life.

204
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.100
 Like if you have an actual LP problem and you

205
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.200
 have to solve system of equations, you're not gonna do this by hand that will

206
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.600
 be ridiculous. Right? We have calculators now.

207
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.700
They calculate to which I'm referring are casts.

208
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.400
CIS computer algebra system

209
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.300
You know like TX, Texas Instruments makes

210
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.300
 them you would plug in your you would

211
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.500
 type in your equation.

212
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.700
Then say software Excel for y and you will get the roots.

213
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.900
Or you could but if you have like many constraints are

214
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.200
 caste system is going is not going to be useful. So

215
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.000
 you want to use something like Matlab or numpy to

216
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.300
 solve many system of equations.

217
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.600
 So in in the in the real world calculation,

218
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.500
 or at least led the

219
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.200
 composition which we'll get to is going to be far.

220
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.900
for a more efficient approach and

221
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.600
 classical logic

222
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.500
and exactly. Yes, you do need to plan a plan of

223
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.800
 attack, but you have to sit down and think through it whereas

224
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.600
 with Technologies like Matlab and

225
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.800
 libraries like numpy you just

226
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.600
Write a line of code and you have the solution.

227
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:44.500
Okay.

228
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.900
But I hope you you now see what we have done.

229
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.100
You know understand Galaxy elimination.
