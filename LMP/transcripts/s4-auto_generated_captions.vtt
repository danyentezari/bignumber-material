Hello there, Ron. Hello there Richard.

1
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.400
Welcome back.

2
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.900
Hey, Danny.

3
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.500
How's it going?

4
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.800
It's a real bang up day.

5
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.200
Banged up day.

6
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.400
bang up

7
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.600
Bang up now. I've never heard of the expression. Is that does that imply

8
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.500
 something positive or not positive?

9
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.900
Right now it implies lots of fireworks.

10
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.000
Oh, oh, there's

11
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.300
 our national holiday Fourth of

12
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.800
 July right right by wow. Yeah.

13
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.200
I'm not been keeping data. I'm not I've kind of lost track

14
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.300
 of the dates. But happy Fourth of July.

15
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.000
you

16
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.200
and

17
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.100
others who are of course celebrating and they're

18
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.200
 just joining in.

19
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.100
Okay, let me do that.

20
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.900
Share my screen.

21
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.200
Let's make this a banged up session.

22
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.800
Okay.

23
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.400
And hello, everybody else. Welcome. Welcome back to

24
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.700
I'll come back to the session.

25
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.500
Let me go ahead and share my screen.

26
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.300
share screen

27
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.100
There we go.

28
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.500
and apply

29
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.000
Before I begin, let me just make a

30
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.000
 comment about slag.

31
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200
And this is especially for you.

32
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.200
Laura because I saw this in your email.

33
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.300
for

34
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.500
Slack you don't actually need to download the

35
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.700
 application.

36
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.200
The one I use is the web version and

37
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.100
the link to the web version is here on

38
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.300
 the side sidebar.

39
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.300
So when you visit the dashboard click on the link.

40
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.800
NOW Watch What Happens

41
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.200
You will see something that looks you might see something like that. Looks

42
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.200
 like this now I use Firefox. You might be

43
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.500
 using chrome doesn't matter. You'll be prompted to open the

44
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.900
 application.

45
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.700
the desktop application

46
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.900
All you have to do is click on cancel.

47
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.700
and then you can use

48
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.100
you just click on the link to direct you to

49
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.800
 the web browser.

50
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.900
and of course raw newer allowing to this video, you know, and if

51
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.500
 a few sessions ago that that you

52
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.400
 know, it forces you to open this

53
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.500
The desktop version. Unfortunately, I couldn't find something that that

54
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.400
 you know the best I couldn't find an alternative that

55
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.800
 is as good as slack this code.

56
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.900
The power Discord is we have a huge, you know.

57
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.500
number of people in here it will be

58
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.200
I'm impossible to get it to join Discord because

59
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.800
 not many it's not as why they adopted as this court many people use stack

60
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.200
 professionally.

61
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.200
So it's it's no bother for them to

62
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.900
You slack, so please keep that at mind. Okay, if you

63
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.300
 don't join slack or

64
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.800
 if you don't participate on slack you're going to miss out.

65
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.100
On discussions attachments exercises

66
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.200
 and you won't be able to ask.

67
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.500
I mean, it's the best place you want to go if you have any questions.

68
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.600
So just keep that in mind. Yeah, I click on the sidebar.

69
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.600
This link here in the sidebar.

70
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.200
And if you prompt it to open the applications click on

71
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.900
 cancel and navigate your way to the link.

72
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.500
Very well. Let's talk about today's agenda.

73
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.200
Now we are.

74
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.500
starting module 3 module 3 and

75
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.900
 module 4

76
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.900
are two weeks in duration, and they are continuous.

77
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.200
why well because

78
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.400
we're going to be focusing on Matrix operations.

79
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.700
the different types of matrices

80
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.700
Matrix operations the applications of Matrix operations,

81
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.700
 and of course

82
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.900
Matrix operations with numpy

83
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.600
today for example

84
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.100
We're going to talk cover a few important things.

85
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.200
gaussian elimination

86
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.200
I've talked about this.

87
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.500
And I've shown you a picture

88
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.100
 that should give you an idea, but I actually want us to do it.

89
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.000
an actual exercise

90
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.900
we look at the notation.

91
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.200
For gaussian elimination and we will apply the numpy and

92
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.500
 the reason I want us to start with gaussian elimination

93
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.600
 because this will give us a reason to want

94
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.500
 to talk about different types of matrices.

95
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.600
And one particular type of Matrix that we want to look at

96
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.900
 is the identity Matrix.

97
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.800
the identity Matrix and the inverse Matrix

98
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.700
and in order for us to understand this we would have to

99
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.500
Talk about Matrix arithmetic multiplication in

100
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.700
 particular.

101
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.500
So for number one, we will do this for linear algebra,

102
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.800
 and then of course.

103
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.800
numpy

104
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.400
numpy

105
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.200
Okay, and then we can move on and talk about

106
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.200
 Led composition. So I

107
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.900
Should you one algorithm?

108
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.300
That was for one part of the LED composition. So

109
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.800
 we want to revisit that today LED composition.

110
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.900
And actual example of it.

111
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.500
both in linear algebra and numpy

112
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.700
now numpy has a method for

113
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.000
LED composition so first we will see how

114
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.200
 we can do manually with numpy and then

115
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.400
 we'll use the method.

116
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.500
LED composition, of course

117
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.700
is one

118
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.100
powerful technique for solving systems of

119
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.100
 equations. So gaussian elimination is one of them this is

120
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.400
 but

121
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.100
Cumbersome, right? I said this before it is you have to do

122
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.300
 a lot of arithmetic row interchanging to get to a solution.

123
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.500
But this is another one.

124
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.500
Okay, so by putting our focus on LED composition

125
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.100
 will learn.

126
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.200
the purpose

127
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.800
of different shapes different Arrangements

128
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.800
 of matrices numpy

129
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.000
and of course

130
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.200
Later on, we can apply we can transfer

131
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.100
 our skills to talking about determinants than

132
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.300
 the characteristic polynomial and leading up

133
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.100
 to PCA. And then once we're

134
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.600
 at PC, then we ready for module 4 we will

135
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.700
 talk about neural networks.

136
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.100
And dimensional reduction. Okay,

137
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.900
 so we have two weeks to

138
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.500
really properly understand matrices

139
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.300
Okay.

140
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:04.500
All right.

141
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.000
and I I think we probably

142
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.100
 going to have to revisit this again

143
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.400
 and

144
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.100
on Tuesday Wednesday, excuse me, our second session because

145
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.200
we do have to do a lot of quite a bit of writing to

146
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.400
 really understand what's going on in here. Okay, let's begin.

147
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.700
I will open a new file.

148
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.100
And I will call this.

149
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:41.800
Matrix

150
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.500
operations

151
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.100
Okay, and this is for yeah, this is for later.

152
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:52.800
Okay.

153
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.500
Matrix operations

154
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.100
so

155
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.400
let me give you some context.

156
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.600
By revisiting the systems of equity

157
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.400
 the system of equations we had from our last.

158
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.600
session

159
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.200
the linear programming problem remember the

160
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.200
 objective function and the

161
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.500
Oh and the constraints?

162
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.700
So I'm just going to copy those constraints.

163
00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.200
And this is what we had before.

164
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.200
And also I edited the video.

165
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.500
From our last Edition because I was living out.

166
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.100
The scientific notation part I'm just going to keep it in here,

167
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.900
 right? So this is not

168
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.100
This is not 3,000. It's actually 30 million and This is 40 million.

169
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.100
Okay. Now if we the way we

170
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.800
 found the roots of these.

171
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.300
Constraints was through classical algebra

172
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.500
 right move this term to the right side move

173
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.700
 that term to this side.

174
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.400
And then you know what algebra is about it's about limit. It's

175
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.500
 about simplifying it right cancellation canceling from

176
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.400
 both sides adding from adding to both sides reducing from

177
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.600
 both sides dividing Etc.

178
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.600
gaussian elimination

179
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.300
allows us to solve for the roots, but

180
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.600
Without having to move the terms from one

181
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.200
 side to the next.

182
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.100
and it is the stepping stone to get into LED composition which

183
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.700
I don't want to say simplifies, but

184
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.000
Makes the process more efficient.

185
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.600
So what we're going to look at is solving systems of equations.

186
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.100
more efficiently

187
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.400
anyway to represent this.

188
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.700
these two inequalities

189
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.700
and of course what we did in

190
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.900
the lp problem was to express these as equations.

191
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.200
but

192
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.300
it would get this.

193
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.500
Matrix

194
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.400
so obviously we would not bring the variables in

195
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.400
 here. We would know what variables these numbers

196
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.600
 stand for because if we follow the order right 100x,

197
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.100
 so that's 100 is

198
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.200
 of social with x.

199
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.100
This 100 is associated with that why you get the idea?

200
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.100
And the reason I put these parentheses is so that you know

201
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.100
 that you know, I didn't really for this for this term.

202
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.000
So you know that this is one number.

203
00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.900
This is one number.

204
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.000
Okay. Now this is called an augmented Matrix.

205
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.200
It's called augmented because

206
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.400
this Matrix is actually the union of

207
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:11.600
 two.

208
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.300
The Matrix for what's on the

209
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.700
 left side of the inequality inequalities and what's

210
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.200
 on the right side of the inequalities

211
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.500
so

212
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.100
augmented matrices would also be

213
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.200
 denoted like so

214
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.300
You would put a vertical bar.

215
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.200
I could put

216
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.700
some latex here to space them out a little bit.

217
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.100
You have a question Ron. I think you've raised your

218
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:46.200
 hand.

219
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.300
Yeah, and I hope I'm not jumping ahead. But

220
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.600
 is there some significance to the fact that

221
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.200
 in your equation on the

222
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.900
 right side, you're listing it as 3,000 times

223
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.500
 10 to the fourth as opposed to.

224
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.100
3.0 times 10 to the seventh

225
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.600
Oh, yeah, there's some reason for that.

226
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.100
yes, the answer is it was easier

227
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.100
 for me because I took this problem just change the

228
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.800
 numbers a little bit from the problem the book and

229
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.700
yeah, it's it was not gonna matter to the content. No, no.

230
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.400
 No. I just wanted to I was too lazy

231
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.500
 with the algebra, you know, I don't like to do addition to

232
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.200
 subtract. So I just

233
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.300
Pended in the problem. It was a had to do with wheat in barley.

234
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.000
And it was 3,000,4000 pounds.

235
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.200
 So adopted this prop. Yeah, I I

236
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.700
 turned this from a small company to an entire,

237
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.700
 you know state-owned container manufacturer.

238
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.200
 So 3,000 pounds is nothing for them. So I

239
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:50.400
 had to

240
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.400
you know blow up the proportion. So I went with 30 million power

241
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.300
 30 million pounds.

242
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.200
So it was laziness and that's it.

243
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:00.600
Okay.

244
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:03.700
Yes.

245
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.000
So let me show you how we would go about solving this.

246
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.600
system of inequalities with gaussian elimination

247
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.000
so here

248
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.100
and I'll come back to why I even brought up

249
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.200
 augmented matrices because it has to with LED composition when

250
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.400
 we do LED composition.

251
00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.400
We separate.

252
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:30.900
the

253
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.400
terms on the left side of the equation and the terms

254
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.900
 of the right side of the equation, okay?

255
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.400
So, let me let me get I'll come

256
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.300
 back to this idea later.

257
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.600
Okay, I'll come back to this.

258
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.500
So this is

259
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.000
representing

260
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.400
inequalities

261
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.400
Or even equations for that matter. It doesn't really matter.

262
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.000
with you or

263
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.700
in a system of equally in a system

264
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.600
equations

265
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.700
assistant matrices

266
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.300
in a matrix

267
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:20.100
Okay.

268
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:22.600
so here

269
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.200
we have our solar systems. Now. How would we

270
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:28.700
 solve this?

271
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.400
again to solve a system

272
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:33.900
is to have

273
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.000
an upper triangle

274
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.100
an upper triangle looks like this.

275
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.500
Upper triangular Matrix. Sorry

276
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.900
and an upper triangular Matrix

277
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.500
This is the upper trying right? This is the other triangle.

278
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.400
You have a leading zeros.

279
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.700
Under their main or what we call the principal diagonal.

280
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.000
So every number to the right or above the

281
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.000
 principal diagonal is a non-zero value.

282
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.000
and everything obviously below that is a

283
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.400
This is zero.

284
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.300
So this is called Echelon 4 this whole

285
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.100
 Matrix, but that is called the upper. This is the upper triangle.

286
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:33.600
now

287
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.400
to solve for the roots of the

288
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.200
 inequalities

289
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:40.700
the numbers

290
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.400
of the upper triangle must also be once

291
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.100
so this would be one one one and you know,

292
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.800
 everything else that we would be zero.

293
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.300
Okay, so for Led composition, we don't

294
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.300
 need to make these ones.

295
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.200
But when we do gaussian elimination, we do

296
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.600
 what these to be once. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that this is upper triangle.

297
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.300
Okay, so we need to get our inequality our

298
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.100
 system rather in Upper triangular form and then

299
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.700
 get these.

300
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.300
What why do we do also called pivots the numbers across the

301
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.800
 principal diagonal cultivates?

302
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.100
 We need to make these pivots equal to one.

303
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.800
So let me show you and of course. This is a

304
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.400
this is reduced. Well reduce row Echelon

305
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.100
 form. So once we get the pivots across the

306
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.100
 diagonal equal to one we have then achieved reduced row

307
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:32.700
 Echelon form.

308
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.600
I'm going to keep this picture as reference.

309
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:41.800
so

310
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.600
reduced

311
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400
five

312
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.300
reduced

313
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.500
a row

314
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.000
echelon

315
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:56.800
for

316
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200
let's make a little bit bigger.

317
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:09.900
Okay.

318
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:11.800
one one

319
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.200
so, let's see how we can do this equation.

320
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.800
So I'm going to copy it again.

321
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.600
And paste it.

322
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.800
with the Galaxy elimination

323
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.800
That's what we're going to talk about now.

324
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.100
gaussian elimination

325
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.900
we can use these Matrix we can use.

326
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.500
one row

327
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.200
to either

328
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.500
and we usually would eliminate okay to when you

329
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.400
 get your Matrix in

330
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.700
 reduced row Echelon form you have eliminated the

331
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.300
 roads.

332
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.300
To eliminate means well again you have

333
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.300
 leading ones on you have one on the principal

334
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.700
 diagonal zeros.

335
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.800
below the principal diagonal

336
00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.600
so in order for us to eliminate

337
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.900
these rows we can use them against each other.

338
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.800
So, for example, I can take row number two.

339
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.700
Subtract it from row number one or vice versa,

340
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.400
 or I can multiply one of these rows by

341
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.000
 some other number.

342
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:28.800
and then

343
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.800
that row

344
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.400
whose values have now become multiples of some other

345
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.100
 number I can subtract from the first row.

346
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.600
This one should be difficult to do so for example and just again

347
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.700
 for notational convenience.

348
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.700
 I'm going to lose.

349
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.200
That tend to the power 4 and I hope you're okay with

350
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.200
 that. I'm just gonna lose that because you know the separate the

351
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.400
 notation.

352
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.600
the easier it will be for us to

353
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.200
keep track of what's going on.

354
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.100
and I'm gonna lose this parentheses really get

355
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.200
all that clutter out of the way.

356
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.400
So again, I want this to be a leading one.

357
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.100
And you know what just to simplify this

358
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.800
 so we don't spend too much time. I'm going to reorder these and that's perfectly

359
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.600
 fine. The that's within Gauss

360
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.600
 and elimination. You can swap roles. Okay. Anyway, I

361
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.400
 what I've done is I've now swapped.

362
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.900
other roles, in fact to denote this we

363
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.600
 would do we would say this r

364
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.500
sub 2

365
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.900
and then a right arrow.

366
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.000
R sub 1

367
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.200
That means R2 has been replaced with R1.

368
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.200
now in your opinion

369
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.600
How can I

370
00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.800
Get this to be reduced.

371
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.300
Assume this was two.

372
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.500
This was one and this was one and one.

373
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.400
What would we have to do to reduce this to eliminate

374
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.900
 this role?

375
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.300
Well, I would say we would subtract row two

376
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.000
 from Row 1.

377
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.400
so the difference of this

378
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.300
 row and that row and then

379
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:24.800
 the

380
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.000
Result of that difference. I would

381
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.300
 put back into Row 1.

382
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.200
Let me show you what I mean. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to subtract row two

383
00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.900
 from Row 1.

384
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.400
and the order is important right because

385
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.200
If I subtract 200 minus 100, I'll get a

386
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.200
 positive number. Whereas I'll get a negative number

387
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.100
 the other that we round so I'm going to subtract row two from Row 1

388
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.900
and then I'm going to take this evaluation.

389
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.000
This result and replace it with the

390
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.700
 Row 1 so I will get something that looks like this.

391
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.200
This becomes 100.

392
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.200
So 200 minus

393
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.500
 100 gives you 100.

394
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.100
100 minus 100 this is going to give me zero.

395
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.100
And then 4,000 minus 3,000 that's gonna give me

396
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.800
 1,000.

397
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.500
There we go. So I have 100 up

398
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:19.600
 here.

399
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.000
Now I need to get this.

400
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:23.800
To be a zero.

401
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.000
Okay.

402
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.300
We're doing calcium elimination.

403
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.800
Now, let's see how I can get rid of that. I can subtract. Well,

404
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.300
 well 100 minus 100 and so

405
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:35.800
 basically this

406
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:37.400
I will subtract.

407
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.400
This Row from that row and then

408
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.100
 the result.

409
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.000
I will plug it inside Row 1.

410
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.200
But if I subtract this from that, I'm going

411
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.400
 to get a I'm going to get a negative 2000. I don't want negative two thousand.

412
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.800
 So I'll do Row one minus row two, so I'm

413
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.300
 going to go.

414
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.700
Row one

415
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.000
minus Row 2

416
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.000
and then whatever the evaluates to I'm going to plug that into Row 1.

417
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.500
So we will get something that looks like this.

418
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.400
Okay, 100 minus 100. That's just zero.

419
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.400
100 minus 100 that will stay 100

420
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.400
and then 3,000 minus 1,000 gives

421
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.100
 us 2000.

422
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.500
Look at that.

423
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.000
now we have

424
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.000
a upper triangle

425
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.600
The last thing I need to do is get these to be once.

426
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.700
And what I will do is I will multiply this by one

427
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.300
 over 100.

428
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.700
So cancel them out so to denote

429
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:47.800
 that.

430
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.000
step

431
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:51.900
I'm going to say.

432
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.100
I'm going to say.

433
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.700
that I will multiply

434
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.100
I will multiply.

435
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.200
all the numbers on Row 1 with 1 over

436
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:13.600
100

437
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.500
and then

438
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.700
I'm going to

439
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.000
replace Row 1

440
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.400
what the result of this?

441
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.700
calculation right arrow

442
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.700
so that will do what it will give me.

443
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.800
100 over 100

444
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.000
100 over 100. That's just one.

445
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.700
Zero over 100. That's just zero and then 1000 over

446
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.100
 100 is just 10.

447
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.100
And then I'm going to do the same thing for row number two, so I'm

448
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.300
 going to copy this bit.

449
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.200
Okay.

450
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.000
I'm gonna do the same

451
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.300
 thing for row number two.

452
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.400
Okay.

453
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.600
multiply these values

454
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.400
with one over 100

455
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.000
and then this is what's going to happen.

456
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.900
So zero over 100 this is going to be zero.

457
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.600
That's going to be one.

458
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.900
And then 2,000 over 100 is going to be 20.

459
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.000
And of course, I hope you can see the solution. It's with

460
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.000
 we've managed to do it if I

461
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.000
put put back.

462
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:46.500
the

463
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:47.800
You know.

464
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:50.500
times 10 to the power 4

465
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.100
Well, we'll get this Matrix.

466
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.500
This one sorry but 10 to the power 4.

467
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.200
times 10 to the power 4

468
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.000
times 10

469
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.100
To the power of 4.

470
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.200
This is exactly what we had seen in our last

471
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:13.300
 session.

472
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.100
Right. So what is this if we plug in these

473
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.100
 values back into the

474
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.900
Inequalities we had this would give us or after

475
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.100
 we turn the ecology the equations we would get One X.

476
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.800
plus 0y equals 10

477
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.000
times

478
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.800
10 to the power 4 which is 10 million.

479
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.500
And then for the one below.

480
00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.300
the one below this would become zero X

481
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.500
1 y

482
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:53.900
20

483
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.000
times 10 to the power 4

484
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.300
and of course if we get rid of these zeros, I'm

485
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.100
 only putting the leading one just so you can see how I

486
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.900
 imply like what I'm plugging these numbers.

487
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.200
but in algebra, of course, we don't actually put

488
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.000
one

489
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.600
we don't put the coefficient one.

490
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.600
That because that's implied. It's there. So the

491
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.400
 one goes away.

492
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.200
0 y That's Just well, that's nothing that goes

493
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:23.400
 away.

494
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.400
Here down here zero X so the

495
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.100
 X goes away.

496
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.300
And then one why we don't actually need to put the Y we

497
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.300
 don't need to put the one and there we go. That's exactly what we have. This

498
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.400
 is the this was the the point on the feasible region.

499
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.400
so

500
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.400
we looked at we have now seen two ways of solving our

501
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.200
 system inequalities one was.

502
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:49.700
with the

503
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.600
Classical algebra and now we've used Gauss elimination from

504
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.800
 linear algebra.

505
00:27:59.400 --> 00:27:59.600
No.

506
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.400
In my opinion, this is still time-consuming.

507
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.600
right, I do you think would you

508
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.700
 say this is simpler than

509
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.300
The algebraic manipulation we saw

510
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.100
 in our last session or easier.

511
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.100
So gaussian elimination versus

512
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.100
Classical object which one do you think is easier?

513
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.700
Those are the same.

514
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.600
I suppose.

515
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.500
I would say however if you're doing multiple inequalities,

516
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.400
 your gaussian will

517
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.000
 will be more will be a lot

518
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.300
 faster.

519
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.100
Which it says more organized I agree because you don't have to move things to

520
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.200
 the left to the right.

521
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.100
But yeah.

522
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.700
I think with some practice you might find.

523
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.800
Galaxy elimination furthermore. Here's another

524
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.000
 thing.

525
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.500
You probably won't do this by hand in real life. Like

526
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.500
 if you have an actual LP problem and you have to solve

527
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.200
 system of equations, you're not gonna do this by hand that will be ridiculous. Right?

528
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.200
 We have calculators now.

529
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.300
They calculate which I'm referring are casts.

530
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.100
CIS computer algebra system

531
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.700
You know like TX, Texas Instruments

532
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.700
 makes them you would plug in your you

533
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.100
 would type in your equation.

534
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.300
Then say software Y and you will get the roots.

535
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600
Or you could but if you have like many constraints our

536
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.700
 caste system is going it's not going to be useful. So

537
00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.500
 you want to use something like Matlab or numpy to

538
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.700
 solve many system of equations. So in

539
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.900
 in the in the real world calculation or

540
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.200
 at least earlier the conversation which we'll get to is

541
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.800
 going to be far.

542
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.900
up for a more efficient approach and classical

543
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.300
 logic

544
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.600
and exactly. Yes, you do need to plan a plan of attack,

545
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.500
 but you have to sit down and think through it whereas with

546
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.200
 Technologies like Matlab and

547
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.500
 libraries like numpy you just

548
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.600
Write a line of code.

549
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.200
And you have the solution.

550
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.100
Okay.

551
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.500
But I hope you you now see what we have done.

552
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.700
You know understand Galaxy elimination.

553
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.000
So we swapped row two with Row 1 we subtracted

554
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.500
 row two from Row 1 and then we the difference

555
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.300
 we plugged into Row 1 and you get the idea.

556
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.000
Okay.

557
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.200
Let me show you the code to do the

558
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.000
 same thing in numpy.

559
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.600
And then what's with familiar with once we get get the syntax

560
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.200
 of numpy? I'll switch over to

561
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.900
 talk about types of matrices.

562
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.500
And then once but then we'll we're ready to talk about Led composition.

563
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.400
So I'm going to open.

564
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.800
new notebook

565
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.100
Matrix operations

566
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.800
ipy

567
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.400
and B

568
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.200
Oh, not again.

569
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.200
I'm telling you this was literally working our while ago.

570
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.800
Why does it happen? Okay, never mind.

571
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.600
Let me just make sure it's yeah, it's 3.9. Okay.

572
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.500
So now what I need to do is go back up here

573
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.800
 and do.

574
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.300
Gaussian elimination, but with no pie. So what I'm gonna first do

575
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.300
 is import numpy.

576
00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:45.700
import

577
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.500
numpy

578
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:50.600
as NP

579
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.500
and then I'm going to use S to represent my

580
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:02.700
system

581
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.300
Cuba great question what vs code plan are using

582
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.100
 it's called Jupiter.

583
00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.300
So if you want to do jupyter notebook whether I recommend this

584
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.700
 versus installing Jupiter notebook separately if you

585
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.800
 click on the extension the

586
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.400
extension icon these four boxes

587
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.500
Search for Jupiter.

588
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.300
do

589
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:26.700
better

590
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.600
and all you need to do is Click.

591
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.400
Install restart vs code and you've

592
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:33.700
 got to go.

593
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.900
Now the reason I have to wait a while for Notebook to

594
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.600
 open up is because I have different python versions.

595
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.300
 I shouldn't uninstall them. But otherwise for you

596
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:45.900
 should be straightforward.

597
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.000
I've attached instructions on the dashboard.

598
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.100
Or vs code so go to the instructions and you

599
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:54.900
 can have the same setup.

600
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.200
Okay, so I'm gonna have

601
00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.400
 S stand for my system of

602
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.900
 in a qualities here. So we have

603
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.200
two rows

604
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:09.600
with

605
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.100
100

606
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.800
and 3,000 again. I'm gonna leave out the 10

607
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.700
 to the power 4 part.

608
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.700
And this is 200.

609
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:21.800
100

610
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.500
4000

611
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.800
Okay, so and of course, I'm going to turn this into a numpy array

612
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.800
 because I want to perform.

613
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.400
Matrix operations using numpy

614
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:35.800
Okay.

615
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:37.700
So let's begin.

616
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.200
Now the first thing I did was swap Row 2

617
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.200
 and Row 1. I'm just going to do that up here. I'm just going to

618
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.500
swap them around like so

619
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:52.200
okay.

620
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:54.400
now

621
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.200
if I want to

622
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.700
subtract row

623
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.500
2 from Row 1

624
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.700
I would do it this way. So we have row.

625
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.300
And of course we have to remember that we count from zero

626
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.900
 in in programming. So if I

627
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.400
 want to say the first row, I would have to put in 0

628
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.300
and if I want to say row two two minus one,

629
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.300
 that's one.

630
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.600
Okay, so I want to subtract these two.

631
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.600
if I say

632
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.000
Now there is something I need. I need you to also know.

633
00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.600
Pie has a methods for Matrix operations.

634
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.600
 So if I say NP

635
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.300
I'm going to go.

636
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.000
difference

637
00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.600
the difference of

638
00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.200
the first

639
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.800
well, what did we do here? We subtracted the second row.

640
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.400
From the first row. So that's S1.

641
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.300
S zero

642
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.300
I knew I'm gonna I knew I should have checked something.

643
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.900
 Let me let me double check something by the way, because I only

644
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.900
 check this for multiplication. Not for difference. Let

645
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.500
 me just confirm.

646
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.100
What does this give me first of all?

647
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.600
Okay, so for addition and subtract, it's for additions difference.

648
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:33.900
 I

649
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.800
I can use python.

650
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.400
You see because if you don't turn into a numpy object.

651
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.400
The default behavior from python is this

652
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.500
 let's say you have to make you have two lists five

653
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.200
 five or four four and five five.

654
00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.200
If you do addition that doesn't apply make sure

655
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.700
 it's just going to append.

656
00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.700
These two lists together.

657
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.100
Up here. However, I am or if up here.

658
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:02.800
 However, I am not.

659
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.000
These are not python lists. These are.

660
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.800
Array objects. Okay. I think

661
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.500
 there is a there is a method for taking difference of

662
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:12.900
 these two.

663
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:14.600
and

664
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.400
in fact, I think I should use the method.

665
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.600
I'll come back this difference method, okay?

666
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.600
I'll come back to the difference method. But yeah, if

667
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.300
 you want to subtract the second row.

668
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.100
From the first row so subtract the second of the first row.

669
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.000
We type in the first row minus second row and

670
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.200
 then it will subtract the second row from the

671
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.300
 first row. And then if I want to replace the first row, I'm

672
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.300
 going to go that's

673
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.100
sub z s of zero.

674
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.600
Equals well that difference.

675
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.800
And to see the result I'm going to Simply print.

676
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.900
Yes, so let me run this again.

677
00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.800
by print s

678
00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.300
you can see we have done just that.

679
00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.000
100 zero 1000 100

680
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.800
okay, and I can continue this way. So right

681
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.500
 now I need to subtract Row 1

682
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.700
 from Row 2 and then plug it into.

683
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.200
row to okay, so that's I mean this was

684
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:42.900
 this was supposed to be

685
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.900
our underscore to

686
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.200
our underscore

687
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.100
to

688
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.900
just make careful here.

689
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.200
Okay.

690
00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.100
So this I'm just gonna copy this bit.

691
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.300
So I'm going to subtract Row 1 from Row 2.

692
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:14.000
Does NP array override minus operation?

693
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.400
Well, yes, because now you're not

694
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.400
 subtracting you're not performing now addition, of

695
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.400
 course in Python it has

696
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:23.800
three

697
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.200
applications you can use it to add to

698
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.100
Numeric data types, so intent float, you can use

699
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.200
 it to concatenate two strings together you can use it to

700
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.200
 merge to list together.

701
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.200
So

702
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.600
I I want to see override because

703
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.100
these are objects so you can also append you

704
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.200
 can also merge to objects together.

705
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:55.900
How do you mean it works?

706
00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.300
Oh you mighty sequel.

707
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:03.200
Minus equal. Oh, okay. I didn't see the equal part. You

708
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.300
 mean decrement?

709
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.700
To take the difference you did you use this to subtract.

710
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.900
a row from another row

711
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.800
If that's what you mean, then yeah that would work because because

712
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.000
 if we say that if

713
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.400
 we do something like a equals.

714
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.300
Or a minus equals for example

715
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.300
 a minus B.

716
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.500
or my a minus equals B this

717
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.300
Is the same thing as saying?

718
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.900
a equals a minus B

719
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.300
So minus equals says whatever a yes

720
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.000
 subtract B from it, so these two are equivalent.

721
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.600
Okay, but I'm

722
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.100
 just trying to make this look as I'm trying to make the python code look

723
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.400
 as much.

724
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.200
To you know to make it as close to what we

725
00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.100
 see in there and in the market and the math

726
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.200
 so here I want to subtract.

727
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.100
the second row from the first row

728
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.100
and then replace the second rule.

729
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.500
And there we have it.

730
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.700
And then you get the idea right then we would multiply the

731
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.400
 first row by whatever 100 and until

732
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.700
 we get to this point.

733
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.300
Until we get X and Y.

734
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.100
Okay.

735
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.600
So I won't finish this this part you

736
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.800
 can you can do this on your but I hope you get the idea now.

737
00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.500
So what I'm going to do from this point I always is

738
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:43.500
show you

739
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:45.300
what?

740
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.600
inverse Matrix identity matrices do

741
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.000
to any any Square Matrix

742
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.000
and then we can see it's output.

743
00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.300
every stop of the way

744
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.000
So now let me open a new

745
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.400
 notebook.

746
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.000
And I'm going to call this.

747
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.200
LED composition you

748
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.100
Take compo.

749
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.300
station

750
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.000
Pi.

751
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.300
first some background into

752
00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.300
linearly composition

753
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.200
Let me come back to the markdown file.

754
00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.100
Suppose we have a matrix.

755
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.200
and we'll call this Matrix a

756
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.900
we can Factor this Matrix.

757
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.200
into two matrices lnu

758
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.300
now what is L? And what is U?

759
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.600
let me make sure to make the letters bold because

760
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.400
you know in linear algebra matrices are

761
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.200
 both capitalized and written both.

762
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:35.500
characters

763
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.100
here

764
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.000
a

765
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.800
is the original Matrix?

766
00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.500
U is the

767
00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.000
upper triangle Matrix

768
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.100
Which is also the solution.

769
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.900
When you eliminate the rows.

770
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.300
So up here. Let me scroll up to give you some if I

771
00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.300
 scroll up here. This is the solution right for our system was a system of

772
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:13.700
 inequalities.

773
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.500
now before we actually

774
00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.000
made these leading ones.

775
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.900
we were able to get it to

776
00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.100
Upper triangular form. This is upper angular form, right?

777
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.700
We have this diagonal if you exclude this augmented part.

778
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:31.400
so here

779
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.100
that's the upper triangle part.

780
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.700
Everything across everything on the principal diagonal

781
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.100
 is a non-zero.

782
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.100
Now, this is small Matrix, but you remember what we talked

783
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.900
 about right upper triangle is this?

784
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:48.700
upper triangle

785
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.200
if you get your Matrix into upper triangular form.

786
00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.000
You have done your elimination.

787
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.000
So this is what they use stands for.

788
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:04.600
Okay.

789
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:05.700
so you

790
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.500
Is the upper triangular?

791
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.100
triangle Matrix

792
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:15.600
then

793
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.900
Ellie the L part the L part is which stands

794
00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.800
 for lower triangle.

795
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.400
is the product of all of

796
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.400
 the elimination matrices so there is

797
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.100
a component that is not part of

798
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:34.300
 this.

799
00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.400
formula the elimination Matrix

800
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.000
Is the product?

801
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:41.700
of

802
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.900
elimination matrices

803
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.200
if there are multiple matrices we would say matrices if there's one

804
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.300
 and then we would say one eliminate elimination Matrix.

805
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:55.800
so

806
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:01.100
What is an elimination Matrix? So now we have to talk about types of

807
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.600
 matrices? Let's first talk about the identity Matrix.

808
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.800
Then let's let me show you how to get to an end to

809
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.000
 get to L triangle.

810
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.100
To a lower triangle Matrix and then you will understand what we mean by

811
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.000
 elimination matrices.

812
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:22.800
so

813
00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.000
let's begin with an example.

814
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.600
Let's say

815
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.100
 we have this Square Matrix.

816
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.400
Let me borrow the related code.

817
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:46.900
from here

818
00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.300
Let's say we have the square Matrix and we will denote this

819
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.500
 with e a.

820
00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.200
What do we have in this Matrix? We have the numbers 1 2 minus 3.

821
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:02.800
1

822
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:03.700
2

823
00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.300
minus 3

824
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.500
then we have three.

825
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.000
or and 13

826
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:11.400
3

827
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.300
thank you for

828
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:14.900
13

829
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.400
and then we have two one and five

830
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.200
 two one.

831
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.000
time

832
00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.000
we want to factorize this Matrix. We want to

833
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.500
 extract from this Matrix.

834
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.700
the L Matrix and the U Matrix

835
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.300
To get to the U Matrix we must first

836
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.700
 do the L Matrix.

837
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.400
To get to the L Matrix. We need a sequence of elimination matrices.

838
00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:46.800
Here's the idea.

839
00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.600
In the previous example where we use gaussian

840
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:50.900
 elimination.

841
00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.200
Yes, we did those raw operations, but we did not keep track.

842
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:57.100
of which

843
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.700
numbers we used

844
00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.500
or what order we used.

845
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.300
Well, I guess you could say we keptract because

846
00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.000
 here I have.

847
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.200
You know R minus R2 replaced R2,

848
00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.800
 but that's not what I mean. When I say keeping track

849
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.500
 of the operations. I mean having a matrix.

850
00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.600
Or a collection of matrices that says you

851
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.100
 did this to row one and then you do this to row two

852
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.300
 and then you do this to row three and these are written in matrices.

853
00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.200
 Now what I actually mean let me show you.

854
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.400
Let me drag this let me implement this

855
00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.100
 Matrix in numpy. So I'm going to keep this

856
00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.200
 here and I'm gonna open LED composition that IP Y and

857
00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:43.200
 B.

858
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.200
Okay, once again, I will import.

859
00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.600
numpy as MP

860
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.000
and then I'm going to recreate this Matrix.

861
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.800
so we have in

862
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.300
P dot array, okay

863
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.400
NP dot array

864
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.000
And this has three rows.

865
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.000
one two

866
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.700
two negative 3

867
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.000
and then we have negative 3.

868
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.200
negative 4

869
00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.200
and 13

870
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.000
and then finally we have two.

871
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.100
one

872
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.100
Okay.

873
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.400
The first thing we are going to do is

874
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.300
what we want to do is again, we want to get to Upper triangular form,

875
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:48.900
 right so we want

876
00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.000
This to be zero.

877
00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.600
and then these two to be 0

878
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.100
okay this to be zero is to be 0

879
00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.100
 this to be 0 and everything across the diagonal should be

880
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:01.900
 a non-zero value.

881
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.500
How would we get rid of?

882
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.900
Negative 3 that's the first thing we need to make 0.

883
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:10.800
Well, let's see one way to get rid of three.

884
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.100
Is to First multiply this row by 3.

885
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:16.900
So this would come 3.

886
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.200
This would become 6 that would become negative 9 but we

887
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:23.600
 don't care about these two what's important to us? Is that if we

888
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.600
 multiply this row by three then we

889
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.900
 could add these two together.

890
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.600
Three plus negative 3 would cancel out row two.

891
00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.300
And as far as we're concerned that's considered elimination.

892
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.300
Now we could also now

893
00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:45.300
 I could I can use the same code I did another file.

894
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.200
As zero plus S2, but that's

895
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.200
 gaussian elimination. We don't want to do gaussian lamination and

896
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.200
in the elimination Matrix

897
00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.500
Okay, let me show you what I mean.

898
00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.700
Now this I will denote as a

899
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.900
And then I'm going to create a matrix called I called NP

900
00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.900
 dot array. This is gonna be the identity Matrix that

901
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.500
 I've been talking about.

902
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.000
What's in the identity Matrix?

903
00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.800
You have a square Matrix.

904
00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.200
That is the same size as the

905
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.500
Matrix to what you want to

906
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.200
Multiply this identity Matrix and we have these values.

907
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.200
This becomes 0 this becomes one.

908
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.900
This becomes zero. This becomes 1 basically, I an identity

909
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:45.400
 Matrix.

910
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.600
Is a matrix with zeros

911
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.500
 everywhere except across the diagonal the

912
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.100
 main diagonal?

913
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.500
Why is it called a why is it called identity Matrix?

914
00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:57.900
 Let me show you.

915
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.300
I will show you the result of this evaluation.

916
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.300
And then I'll show you a picture.

917
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.500
I'm going to go NP.

918
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.700
dot matte more

919
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.700
this is short for matrix multiplication.

920
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.800
So I'm going to apply the identity Matrix to

921
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.400
 the original Matrix.

922
00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.500
When I multiply this.

923
00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:26.500
You can see we get the same Matrix again.

924
00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:29.300
I mean, it's the same thing.

925
00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.100
one two negative 3

926
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:36.300
1 to negative 3 negative 3 negative 4 13 negative.

927
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.400
 How was this possible?

928
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.500
Well, let me show you. Well, this is the result of matrix multiplication. So

929
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.000
 I'm going to pull up a picture of Matrix.

930
00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:44.900
multiplication

931
00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.400
and the way it works is

932
00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.100
This is a this is a good example the way you will multiply

933
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.000
 two matrices.

934
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:01.800
easy with multiply

935
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:02.900
well

936
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:04.800
the first number

937
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.400
in the first row times the first number

938
00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.400
 in the First Column of the second row.

939
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:13.600
then the

940
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.300
first number second number of

941
00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.200
 the first row times the second number

942
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.400
In the First Column of the second Matrix see that's

943
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.400
 a mouthful if you look at the picture you should get the idea.

944
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.400
And then the product and then the sum I should say the sum.

945
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.100
of these two products or two times three zero times

946
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.200
 four that would become the first value in the

947
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.200
resulting Matrix

948
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:45.300
so

949
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:50.100
I don't want to have to do this by hand because we'll run out of time.

950
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.000
 But I want you to trust me when I say, okay. Let me see if I can do identity

951
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.600
 Matrix identity.

952
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:56.200
identity

953
00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.700
the by arranging the numbers and

954
00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.400
 identity Matrix

955
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.400
Like what we just saw we will get back the same resulting Matrix.

956
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:07.500
hopefully

957
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.400
yeah, look at this one.

958
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.600
so one times

959
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.400
this is not clear. Let's try not one.

960
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.400
You can take a second or two to look at this. So one times a

961
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.200
And then 0 times C. And then

962
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.200
 zero times e holy see these zeros

963
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.700
 right these zeros.

964
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.500
are going to cancel out the other terms and

965
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.000
 all you left is one times a

966
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.100
and what times a is just a

967
00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:58.500
Okay.

968
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.900
So I'm going to take this picture, but

969
00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.300
 for now look at this so that you're convinced that.

970
00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.300
The identity Matrix will give you the make the

971
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.900
 original Matrix. I'll put a picture of it in the tutorial.

972
00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:13.900
but

973
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.100
let's just accept that this is the I did The Matrix will give you the

974
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:18.600
 same Matrix.

975
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.200
I'm going to put this over here.

976
00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.000
identity Matrix

977
00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.000
I'll clean up the notes here later.

978
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.200
identity

979
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:38.800
Matrix

980
00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:46.700
that's one. There's another one called the inverse Matrix.

981
00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.600
Let me show you a picture of that.

982
00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.100
with the

983
00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.400
inverse Matrix

984
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.800
No, this is not what I wanted to show you.

985
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.000
No, no. Sorry. I I misspoke. This is not what I want to show you right now.

986
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:08.800
This is what I want to show you.

987
00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:10.500
so

988
00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:18.800
let's close this and focus here.

989
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:21.100
Okay.

990
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.100
What we're gonna do now is we're going to play around with this identity

991
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.700
 Matrix.

992
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:31.900
and

993
00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:39.100
we want to use it. We want to use this identity Matrix.

994
00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:41.900
Not to get the same Matrix back.

995
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.700
but to get a third Matrix where

996
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.300
two rows have either been swapped around

997
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:53.600
 or they've been manipulated somehow.

998
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:58.300
So let's take let's do this. Let's do the

999
00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.400
 first one. Let's do the first elimination Matrix.

1000
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:03.900
Slowly so we understand what's going on in here.

1001
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.000
We have one two.

1002
00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.300
Negative 3 and then we have negative 3 negative 4.

1003
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.800
 Okay, what we want to do is get this Matrix.

1004
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.300
gradually into upper triangular form

1005
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:19.200
so to

1006
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.900
To do that we need this negative 3 to become zero.

1007
00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.500
Then we want to get this 2 to 0 and I'll

1008
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:28.800
 give this one to be equal to 0.

1009
00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.500
So these numbers?

1010
00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.000
You must get to be equal to 0.

1011
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.100
using this identity Matrix or

1012
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:44.900
an adaptation of the identity Matrix

1013
00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.500
Let me show you something. I'm going to copy this

1014
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:51.700
 code.

1015
00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:59.200
And instead of having one one. I'm

1016
00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.700
 going to go.

1017
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.600
One one in the opposite direction. So I'm flipping the

1018
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.100
 axis.

1019
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.400
Let's see. What happens when I do that.

1020
00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:12.200
I'm going to call this.

1021
00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.400
Let me

1022
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.000
 give this another name. I'm going to call this I underscore.

1023
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:22.800
Okay.

1024
00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.000
What happens when I do that?

1025
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.300
Can you can you can you see what has

1026
00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:29.500
 happened?

1027
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:31.500
the third row

1028
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.600
Which is 215.

1029
00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.100
Is now at the top.

1030
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.700
And the first row which is one two negative three.

1031
00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.100
Is now at the bottom.

1032
00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.400
By point is the way we would.

1033
00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.400
Where we put a 1.

1034
00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.500
is going to allow us to

1035
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.200
What performable operations then you see if I can give you a

1036
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:05.000
 very simple example?

1037
00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.400
A very simple I will come back this original one.

1038
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.100
 So I'm just going to create a very small Matrix. Let me call this.

1039
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:12.100
M.

1040
00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.100
Just a 2 by 2.

1041
00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:16.400
and

1042
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.400
let's make this.

1043
00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:25.900
to

1044
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.200
and zero

1045
00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.500
and we'll make this one and one.

1046
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.600
Okay, I want to

1047
00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.600
solve this Matrix

1048
00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:40.100
using

1049
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.800
a modified version of the identity Matrix

1050
00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:47.200
Okay.

1051
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:49.500
So we have one zero.

1052
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:53.200
zero one ones across the diagonal obviously

1053
00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.600
and like before if I were to multiply these matrices.

1054
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:03.600
I would get back the same Matrix.

1055
00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.200
Okay, 2 0 1 1 2 0 1

1056
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.300
 1 now if I want to solve this Matrix, I would

1057
00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:12.400
 have to subtract two.

1058
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.400
from one

1059
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:18.300
so

1060
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.400
what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go I'm gonna call this

1061
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.100
 e if we're elimination,

1062
00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:25.800
and

1063
00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:29.000
I'm going to set this to one.

1064
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.100
If I run this, let's see what happens.

1065
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.000
Actually, I want this to be negative one.

1066
00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.200
No.

1067
00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.300
I want this to be.

1068
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.300
Okay, I need to make sure I get the order correct.

1069
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.700
No, no, no one second thoughts. Let me

1070
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:01.700
 cheat.

1071
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.000
What did I put here?

1072
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.300
Yeah, so the elimination yeah the elimination Matrix comes

1073
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:08.500
 first.

1074
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.400
And let me run this again.

1075
01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:13.900
I want this to be.

1076
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:24.700
negative one

1077
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.600
I'll tell you in a second.

1078
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.600
if I want

1079
01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.400
Because the order of the arguments are important the sign is

1080
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.200
 important. So the order of the arguments so here

1081
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.600
I need to go from

1082
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:33.200
Okay.

1083
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.900
Let's do it 200 100.

1084
01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.800
by the first row

1085
01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.500
Just give me a second multiply.

1086
01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.200
Yeah.

1087
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.500
What? Yeah, so I want to multiply the first

1088
01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.000
 row.

1089
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.600
with the second row together 0

1090
01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.300
And then I have the original Matrix.

1091
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:16.000
and then e

1092
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:21.400
yeah.

1093
01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:25.300
Yeah, I have to be careful with the order of these matrices.

1094
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:26.600
Okay.

1095
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:27.800
so

1096
01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.300
let me bring that back.

1097
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.500
So this the original Matrix right again, that's the identity Matrix.

1098
01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.900
one on the principal diagonals

1099
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.600
if I set this to

1100
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.200
negative 1

1101
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.000
here's one way to read it.

1102
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.500
Let me actually plug in more numbers in here just to expand just to

1103
01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.700
 make this bigger. So you have some.

1104
01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.800
A better idea. I will make these zero down here.

1105
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:11.900
Okay.

1106
01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.900
And I need the Matrix to be.

1107
01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.000
the same size

1108
01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.300
Again, if I set this to zero, you have an identity Matrix.

1109
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.300
if I set this to negative 1

1110
01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.500
Basically, here's one way to interpret it.

1111
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.800
We're saying multiply.

1112
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.500
the second row

1113
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.400
or not multiply add to the

1114
01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.000
 second row.

1115
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.900
the difference of the first row

1116
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.900
add to the second row.

1117
01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.800
the difference of the first row

1118
01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.400
So whatever two is.

1119
01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.400
So imagine this is R1.

1120
01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.000
This would be R2. This would be R3.

1121
01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.100
This is one way to this is how you you read the

1122
01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.700
 rows of an elimination Matrix.

1123
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.900
Add two row two.

1124
01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.900
negative one of R1

1125
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.200
so basically multiply these by negative 1

1126
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.600
and add it to the second Matrix the second row.

1127
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.200
so when you mother when you add two

1128
01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.000
to

1129
01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:54.500
negative 2 to 1. So that's

1130
01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:56.000
two plus one

1131
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.300
I just want to make this part clear. So let me just add this comment

1132
01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:21.500
 here.

1133
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.300
So, this is R1 R2.

1134
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.400
all of these are R1

1135
01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.300
R2

1136
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.300
2

1137
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.800
or 2 and everything here's R3. So basically

1138
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.800
 here's what I'm trying to say.

1139
01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:41.000
Okay.

1140
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:45.500
Because elimination Matrix is a type of encoding

1141
01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:45.900
 Matrix.

1142
01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.800
if you keep

1143
01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.900
What's across the diagonal to one so if I keep this one I'm

1144
01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:55.200
 saying.

1145
01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.900
Keep Row 1 what it is.

1146
01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.300
If I make this one and the other zero.

1147
01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:10.700
I'm sick. Do not change row two keep R2

1148
01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:10.900
 what it is.

1149
01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.100
And if I set these to zero.

1150
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:21.300
And I make this one that I'm saying keep R3

1151
01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.500
 what it is.

1152
01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.300
if however I

1153
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.600
make this one I'm saying keep R3

1154
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.000
 what it is.

1155
01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.700
But add R1 to it.

1156
01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.800
So it's like I'm activating rule one.

1157
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.700
Row 1 will be added to

1158
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.000
Row 3

1159
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.200
so for example

1160
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.600
Let me make this 0 again.

1161
01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.200
Okay. Once again, we will get the same Matrix.

1162
01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.300
If I set this to one.

1163
01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.000
well

1164
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.800
Because these are because the these are these are

1165
01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.100
 zeros, right? The third one is a zero.

1166
01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.100
Let me just let me just go back to the a matrix.

1167
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.300
But I'm trying to get across this idea

1168
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:16.500
 that we can play around with this identity

1169
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.000
 Matrix to eliminate.

1170
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.000
And get to the upper triangle.

1171
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.600
So let's return to the above example.

1172
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:31.200
And do this again? Okay. I'm going to go back to

1173
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.300
 the identity Matrix.

1174
01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.100
Set these.

1175
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:36.700
to zero

1176
01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:37.600
Okay.

1177
01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.500
I'll do one example.

1178
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.200
But I think by the second when I get to the second

1179
01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.500
 the third elimination matrices, you should get the idea. Okay.

1180
01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:53.800
so

1181
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:55.900
If I run this now.

1182
01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:58.400
I

1183
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.000
Need to make this one if I run this now, I'm going to

1184
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.100
 get the I say Matrix.

1185
01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.800
So want to negative three one two negative 3.

1186
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.900
Negative 3. Okay. I hope you can see they're all the same. Okay. Now

1187
01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.300
 I'm going to make this my first elimination Matrix.

1188
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.300
To get to my first elimination Matrix. I need to get rid of minus three

1189
01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.700
 and it is to become a zero.

1190
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.300
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create my first elimination Matrix.

1191
01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.600
This will be a modification of the identity

1192
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.000
 Matrix.

1193
01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.800
So to get rid of this.

1194
01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.000
Negative 3 I need to multiply Row three

1195
01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:38.400
 a row once excuse me, multiply Row

1196
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.400
 1 by 3.

1197
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.200
So this will become three. This will become six. This will become negative

1198
01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.600
 9 and then add this row.

1199
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.600
to the second row

1200
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.200
because three plus negative 3 they cancel each other and we

1201
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:51.700
 get to zero.

1202
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.200
So I'm going to go.

1203
01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:56.500
negative 3

1204
01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:58.800
Okay.

1205
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.400
And then I'm going to multiply them together.

1206
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.100
So I'm going to multiply my first elimination Matrix.

1207
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.200
times a

1208
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.000
Okay.

1209
01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.900
It's supposed to be negative 3 or 3.

1210
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.100
It's supposed to be 3.

1211
01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:23.900
So you see here?

1212
01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.100
Our first row is the same.

1213
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.000
Our third row is the same but now we have

1214
01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.600
discarded or I should say we have yeah, we

1215
01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.400
 have discarded the

1216
01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.600
The leading negative 3 in the second row.

1217
01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.700
That's my first elimination Matrix.

1218
01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:49.800
and my so I will now reassign a

1219
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.700
to this evaluation

1220
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.100
Okay, so my a has been updated.

1221
01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:01.900
Like we run this again.

1222
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.700
So now I need to create a second elimination Matrix

1223
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.400
 to get rid of two.

1224
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:09.900
and then one

1225
01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.900
so let's do that. I'm going to copy this.

1226
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.400
Make it a identity Matrix again.

1227
01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.500
And let's see what numbers I need to modify in

1228
01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:29.200
 this identity Matrix to get rid

1229
01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:29.500
 of the two.

1230
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:31.400
Okay.

1231
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.600
To get rid of two.

1232
01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:39.700
I would have to multiply Row 1 by 2.

1233
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.200
And then subtract it from the third row.

1234
01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.400
So negative 2 plus 2 and I will get a leading

1235
01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:51.700
 zero.

1236
01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.400
So what I'm going to do next is

1237
01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.100
multiply

1238
01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.600
Row one

1239
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:02.400
by two

1240
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.200
and then add that to

1241
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:07.700
the second row

1242
01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:10.800
Let's see what that does.

1243
01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.100
This is going to be E2. It has that's the second

1244
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.000
 elimination Matrix.

1245
01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.300
And I actually want this to be negative 2.

1246
01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:27.600
run that

1247
01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.300
I keep getting these signs wrong to be

1248
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:36.700
 careful.

1249
01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.100
Now after turn this from the top don't you need to

1250
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.200
 move the negative 2 down the last row in the

1251
01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.500
 in the E Matrix? Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1252
01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.500
 Yes. You're correct. Oh, correct.

1253
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.400
so I need to

1254
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:53.600
multiply

1255
01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.900
The first row by two and then add it so yeah multiply the

1256
01:11:58.900 --> 01:11:59.600
 first row by two.

1257
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.500
negative 2 rather

1258
01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.500
and then add it to the third row.

1259
01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.100
Yeah, I have to be careful.

1260
01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:07.500
So this is what I want.

1261
01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.400
Multiply the first row by a negative 2 add it

1262
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.000
 to the third row.

1263
01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.500
one more time

1264
01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:18.700
There we go.

1265
01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:22.900
Now don't worry about the second row because we already have the elimination Matrix

1266
01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:23.200
 up here.

1267
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.500
For the second row. We have the element elimination Matrix.

1268
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.900
 This is the elimination Matrix for the third row. So as

1269
01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.600
 you can see we've gotten it to become.

1270
01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.400
A zero, but now there is this negative 3 that also

1271
01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.200
 needs to be a zero.

1272
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.600
So I'm going to create a third

1273
01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.600
 elimination Matrix.

1274
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.200
I'm going to take this again.

1275
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.200
Gonna set this back to zero and let me see what number I

1276
01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:48.900
 must use.

1277
01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:51.600
to get rid of negative 3

1278
01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:53.400
What do you think?

1279
01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.800
How do we get rid of that?

1280
01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:02.100
Negative 3 in the in the middle

1281
01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.300
 of the third row.

1282
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:07.700
So what I could do.

1283
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.600
at 6 over 2

1284
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.100
at 6 over 2. So yes, so at 3 at positive

1285
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.800
 3 to that but I need to

1286
01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:26.200
use one of these so either have to divide this

1287
01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:26.600
 by two.

1288
01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:30.700
or I can multiply this by 1.5 2

1289
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:32.200
 times 1.5 gives us 3

1290
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.800
so what I can do is multiply.

1291
01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:38.600
the first row

1292
01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:41.800
by negative

1293
01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.300
one and a half so three over five is one and half.

1294
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.200
This is negative 1/2.

1295
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.600
And then add that to the third rule so multiply the

1296
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.600
 first rule by a negative 1.5.

1297
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.400
And then add that to the third

1298
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:57.700
 row.

1299
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.300
Okay, hopefully I got this right let me run this and again this needs

1300
01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.100
 to be three.

1301
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.000
This needs to be three.

1302
01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:06.900
run this

1303
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.000
no, I still made a mistake. Let me run this again from the top.

1304
01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.400
 I have to be very careful with when I do this.

1305
01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:15.800
Run it from the top.

1306
01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:24.500
and

1307
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:31.200
okay one more time.

1308
01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.100
One more time. Let's go back.

1309
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.100
I will definitely edit this part out this going back

1310
01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:41.700
 and forth part.

1311
01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.200
Okay, let's do this one more time. So again

1312
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:59.300
I can't think I pressed 9 instead of

1313
01:14:59.300 --> 01:14:59.600
 0.

1314
01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:00.800
one more time

1315
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.800
This is our Matrix. We have negative 3 and we

1316
01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.700
 want to multiply the first row.

1317
01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:11.100
By 1.5.

1318
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.400
To get rid of the third row.

1319
01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.500
2 over 2 goes into one.

1320
01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.400
Okay. Yes. You're correct.

1321
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.800
Okay, let me check two things. Yeah, this should go here.

1322
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.000
Well, I'm reassigning something incorrectly.

1323
01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:55.100
I reassigned something is off here.

1324
01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.400
Let me just copy this Matrix making my life easier. So

1325
01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:01.900
 this is the resulting Matrix going to copy this.

1326
01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.700
And every place it.

1327
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.100
Okay.

1328
01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.500
So I don't have to run this from scratch every

1329
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:11.700
 time.

1330
01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.100
Okay, we want to get rid of the three.

1331
01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.000
in here

1332
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:21.300
Okay.

1333
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:29.300
then

1334
01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:38.400
that's just going to be 0 0.

1335
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:40.100
one

1336
01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.300
zero

1337
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.500
zero and then three over two.

1338
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.000
Okay one more time.

1339
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.500
I think I was wrong about that. I think you had the minus

1340
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.300
 3 over 2 on the right column, but I think you have

1341
01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:02.300
 to put a one in the second column Row three.

1342
01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:07.800
Yes here is that we talked about? Okay. Let me just run this see

1343
01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.300
 the thing is there's so much going on.

1344
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.600
It's easy to lose track.

1345
01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.200
and here

1346
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.000
no, this is definitely I'm getting close to solution.

1347
01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:23.500
But I just misplaced something. Let me just make sure what I

1348
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:23.900
 misplaced.

1349
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.000
two three zero two

1350
01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.400
because I even have my reference code here.

1351
01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:33.900
one two three

1352
01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.300
Yeah, I misplaced. I saw I misplaced one

1353
01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.200
 of these minus pluses have been swapped around.

1354
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:43.400
Okay.

1355
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.400
This is supposed to be.

1356
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.700
This is supposed to be one. How did it get to 11?

1357
01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.400
It's because something up here went wrong.

1358
01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.600
Let me run this one more time.

1359
01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.600
So this is the original Matrix the identity Matrix.

1360
01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.000
Multiply a by the identity Matrix. We'll get the

1361
01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.700
 original Matrix this and that are equivalent.

1362
01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.300
Then I came down here.

1363
01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.700
I took the original Matrix.

1364
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:38.000
These two are the same this one.

1365
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.300
I took the original Matrix.

1366
01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.200
then multiplied three

1367
01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.300
to the first row

1368
01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.500
So this would become three three plus minus 3,

1369
01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:51.400
 this would become zero.

1370
01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.700
And that's how we get the zero down here.

1371
01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.900
So the three has been eliminated.

1372
01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.700
Then let me just copy this Matrix.

1373
01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.300
So this is the new a

1374
01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:10.400
this is the new way.

1375
01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:19.100
Okay, the zero has been eliminated, but now I

1376
01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.800
 need to get two to be eliminated.

1377
01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:24.700
so to get rid of this two, I'm going

1378
01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.400
 to multiply the first row by

1379
01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.400
 negative 2 so negative 2 plus 2

1380
01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.100
And this zero.

1381
01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.000
And the zero disappear so negative 2 plus 2 and

1382
01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.000
 then 0 will disappear.

1383
01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.500
So I'm going to run this.

1384
01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:44.600
Okay.

1385
01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.400
And there we have it.

1386
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.200
The zero has disappeared.

1387
01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.200
Now we're left with this negative 3, so I'm going to copy this.

1388
01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.400
and then I'm going to

1389
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.300
hardcoded

1390
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:06.900
Okay.

1391
01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.000
So this is where we are now.

1392
01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.400
The zero has been eliminated here. The zero has been eliminated here.

1393
01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.500
 But now we need to get rid of this negative 3.

1394
01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:21.100
So what I can do, well, I have two twos here.

1395
01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.900
 I can use either row two or Row 1.

1396
01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:24.400
so

1397
01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:30.100
I could use either one of these I could multiply the second

1398
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.100
 row by 1.5.

1399
01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:36.300
And then add it to the third row.

1400
01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.100
so I can

1401
01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.200
be careful with my signs here.

1402
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.000
I can multiply the second row.

1403
01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:53.300
By 1.5. So this becomes three and then

1404
01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:53.900
 at 3.

1405
01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.700
To negative 3 to get this to disappear.

1406
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.100
Okay, let me try that now.

1407
01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:05.600
And there we have it.

1408
01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.600
So we are now an upper triangle.

1409
01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.100
One two negative three and zeros here.

1410
01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:16.500
Okay, so

1411
01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.200
obviously that was a lot of I had to be very careful

1412
01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.200
 with how I the problem was I was reassigning it. I have

1413
01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:27.900
 to be careful with that.

1414
01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:31.300
And so every time we make a mistake have to go back running from the top. But right

1415
01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:34.200
 now we have this upper triangular form, right? This is what I

1416
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:34.400
 meant to say.

1417
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.800
So the L triangle that I'm referring to is going

1418
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.900
 to be the final.

1419
01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.300
Elimination Matrix. So what do I mean?

1420
01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.600
Let me take those. Let me take the the three

1421
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.600
 elimination Matrix matrices that I created. So I'm going

1422
01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.700
 to open a sidebar here.

1423
01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:57.700
I'm going to add E1 E2

1424
01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.700
 and E3 down here. So this is E3.

1425
01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.600
And then this is E2.

1426
01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.200
And this is E1.

1427
01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.500
Okay.

1428
01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.200
The L. Matrix is going to be.

1429
01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.100
all three of these matrices put together

1430
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.000
so we have

1431
01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.800
1 0 0

1432
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.400
then we have three one zero.

1433
01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.800
By the way, I meant to make this a negative 3.

1434
01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:19.600
But let me just plug in 3 for a second three zero.

1435
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:21.500
0

1436
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:23.400
and then

1437
01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.200
I have a negative 2 here.

1438
01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:31.900
And 3 over 2 here, so I'm going to put here negative 2.

1439
01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:37.300
3 over 2

1440
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.800
and then zero, so this is what

1441
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:42.300
 I mean by

1442
01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:45.900
the L Matrix being the product.

1443
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:47.300
of

1444
01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:51.300
a sequence of elimination matrices

1445
01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:55.400
And this is what I meant to say. This is what I meant when I said the

1446
01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.200
In LED composition we keep track of

1447
01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.500
 our operations. So it's one thing to write down the steps.

1448
01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:06.600
 It's another thing to put them into matrices like

1449
01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:06.800
 so

1450
01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:07.700
Okay.

1451
01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.800
So let me push these away.

1452
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.900
Get everything to be nicely aligned.

1453
01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.500
Question the chat someone's on the diagonal needed.

1454
01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:28.200
Yes. Yes this one we need correct?

1455
01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.200
Be very careful.

1456
01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.500
Okay. Now I want to show you what happens when I multiply L

1457
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.500
 by U now when I look at my notes, I

1458
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.300
 noticed that I misplaced.

1459
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.200
the signs

1460
01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:45.300
so

1461
01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.900
For example here. I have to put a negative 3.

1462
01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.300
And here I meant to make this two.

1463
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.300
And make this negative.

1464
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:04.100
So this would be two this would be negative.

1465
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.300
And this would be negative 3 because my

1466
01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.200
 original Matrix.

1467
01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.800
Let me write it down. You know, it's just safer to write things down.

1468
01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:20.400
From scratch when you make mistakes like this, so that's a

1469
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:20.800
 small Matrix.

1470
01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.100
And let me pay careful attention. So this is

1471
01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:25.600
one

1472
01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:32.900
two and negative 3 and the

1473
01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:35.000
 first row second row is negative 3

1474
01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.200
negative 4

1475
01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:41.200
13

1476
01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:43.900
2

1477
01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:46.600
1

1478
01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.300
negative 5

1479
01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:51.700
all right.

1480
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:57.100
So this is the a this is the original Matrix. This is

1481
01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:00.200
 the L Matrix now the upper Matrix. The U Matrix

1482
01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:00.600
 is the

1483
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.100
Matrix after we

1484
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.600
eliminated everything below the lower triangle. So that

1485
01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.200
 was this one.

1486
01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.000
I'm not going to scroll up because I have it right here.

1487
01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.200
array

1488
01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.100
so this would be

1489
01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:24.400
the solution Matrix

1490
01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.900
it's the same thing we saw above but

1491
01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.200
Earlier, I got the side. I got the negatives wrong. So I'm just going to type it here

1492
01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.900
 correctly. So after we solve The Matrix a

1493
01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:39.500
 we get one.

1494
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.700
two negative 3

1495
01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:45.800
and then we have 0

1496
01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:47.300
to

1497
01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:49.900
4

1498
01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.200
and then 0

1499
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:54.500
0

1500
01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.900
and this would be seven.

1501
01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.100
okay, the idea is this If I multiply

1502
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.600
these two matrices together I should get back.

1503
01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.900
the original Matrix

1504
01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:12.100
So, let's see that I'm gonna add another cell here. I'm going

1505
01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:16.400
 to go NP dot mat multiply matrices.

1506
01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:20.000
And I have to be careful with the order the order matters.

1507
01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.400
I'm going to go yes L times

1508
01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.700
 U.

1509
01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:29.000
So if I make if I multiply these two these are the fact that

1510
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.200
this is the factorization of the Matrix C. I should

1511
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.700
 get back the same Matrix.

1512
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:37.700
So, let's see.

1513
01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.100
I need to run this cell first.

1514
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:45.300
And I'm gonna run this.

1515
01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.000
Now these are floats, but if I scroll up a little

1516
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:50.100
 bit.

1517
01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.100
I think I got the signs wrong

1518
01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:57.200
 again.

1519
01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.800
Because the first dose, correct.

1520
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.400
The second row where did I misplace the

1521
01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.900
 sign? One, two, three three four thirteen.

1522
01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:09.100
two one negative 5

1523
01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.500
this is one.

1524
01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:15.700
zero zero negative 3 1 0

1525
01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:15.800
 there

1526
01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:17.700
3 1 0

1527
01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:19.600
2

1528
01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.400
3 1 okay one more time.

1529
01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.500
Yeah, now we have the same Matrix.

1530
01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:35.200
Okay, so one two negative three one two

1531
01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:35.500
 negative 3.

1532
01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.900
and I can even convert this to an

1533
01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:43.300
Integer by using the as type method so I'm going to go ask type

1534
01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.000
 make this an image integer.

1535
01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.200
There we go. So now we have the same Matrix as

1536
01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:48.800
 we had about.

1537
01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.300
You know one to negative 3 1 to negative 3 3 4 yeah.

1538
01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:58.400
Okay, so I obviously I made a

1539
01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.300
 few mistakes along the way.

1540
01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.700
But my point was this to summarize.

1541
01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:06.600
What we can do is we can take a square Matrix.

1542
01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.200
And factorize it

1543
01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.000
 into two matrices.

1544
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.700
The lower Matrix which is the combination

1545
01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:18.500
 of the elimination matrices. We

1546
01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:18.800
 just saw.

1547
01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:23.100
And then once you eliminate eliminate eliminate you get to

1548
01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:25.500
 the upper triangle Matrix.

1549
01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:30.000
So we need elimination of matrices to get

1550
01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:30.900
 to the L Matrix.

1551
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:34.200
And once we get to the other Matrix viewer also acquired the

1552
01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:34.600
 U Matrix.

1553
01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:37.100
This will become a factor.

1554
01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.200
In our next session, I'm going to review this will

1555
01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.600
 also do an exercise on this.

1556
01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:43.600
and

1557
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.700
I'm going to show you how to solve an actual system of equations.

1558
01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.700
using LED composition

1559
01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:55.000
So if you can see here our lower

1560
01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:55.700
 triangular Matrix.

1561
01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.100
Or I should say our upper triangular. Matrix is

1562
01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:03.000
 does not have leading ones. So we want to see how we can

1563
01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.000
 go from lud composition to reduce row shillon form.

1564
01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.600
And that perhaps add this to our specific equations.

1565
01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:12.400
Any question or comments before I in

1566
01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:15.400
 the session because I have one more comment about the assignment from

1567
01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.700
 module 1 any questions comments.

1568
01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:24.200
Now, of course, I'm going to go back and edit this video check out the parts

1569
01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.400
 where I was scrolling up and down.

1570
01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:29.600
So when you watch this back, it's not annoying. Yes. So just just be

1571
01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.600
 clear. Your L. Matrix is the complete elimination

1572
01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:36.200
 lower elimination make tricks.

1573
01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:40.600
Yes, if you want we can see something. Let me see you

1574
01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.500
 so I'm just gonna hopefully Google will show us a picture.

1575
01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:46.600
of that expression so Leu decomposition

1576
01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.100
the composition

1577
01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.500
elimination

1578
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:53.800
matrices

1579
01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.000
I think I had a PDF open here somewhere.

1580
01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.000
This is one but it's not complete.

1581
01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:38.300
You know, sometimes you have to do a bit of Google to find what

1582
01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:41.100
 you're looking for. But yeah, that's that's the that's the idea.

1583
01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.400
That's the idea.

1584
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:45.600
Any other questions?

1585
01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:49.700
Elimination matrices, please.

1586
01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:54.600
Marks now, let me tell you about the assignment. I was supposed to post it

1587
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.500
 post it yesterday.

1588
01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.900
But I'm actually onboarding other

1589
01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:01.600
 lecturers.

1590
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:06.300
All of whom will have phds all of them who have

1591
01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:09.700
 experience teaching in Academia. So what I'm trying to do is, you know,

1592
01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.700
 raise the bar and bring more advanced

1593
01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.000
 mathematics.

1594
01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.000
But I'm going to post it. I'm

1595
01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.300
 gonna try to post it today. And of

1596
01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:22.100
 course I will extend the I want I will

1597
01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.500
 adjust the deadline to accommodate for

1598
01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.300
You know the delay but assignment will

1599
01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:30.200
 be very similar to the lp problem. We did and of course you can use.

1600
01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.000
the techniques we saw today guys elimination LED

1601
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:35.400
 composition to

1602
01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:39.200
solve that

1603
01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:41.100
LP problem

1604
01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.000
I think I found one here.

1605
01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:06.400
Yeah, something like this, but I'm not

1606
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.900
 sure about this website.

1607
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.100
You know what? I always say about Google. I'll write it

1608
01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:16.600
 down a lot. I'll add notes here. But this is the yeah. This is the idea the Lord

1609
01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.100
 the L. Matrix is the product of

1610
01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:21.200
 elimination matrices, okay.

1611
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.000
Okay, everybody.

1612
01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.500
So that's it for today's session.

1613
01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.900
I need to come up with a way to write the code and not

1614
01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:37.200
Like go up and down so many times. So I what I'm

1615
01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.700
 gonna try to do is write the code in advance just paste it to avoid

1616
01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:43.500
 any back and forth. But sometimes I have to sometimes I have to

1617
01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:46.200
 answer questions after making modification. Anyway, just keep your

1618
01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:46.800
 eye out please on the

1619
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.800
Dashboard because the assignment will appear here. There will be two links link

1620
01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.700
 to the assignment link this

1621
01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.500
 submission for and please don't forget what I said about if

1622
01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.600
 you haven't joined slack yet you do so.

1623
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.300
Okay, because I'm going to add comments in here

1624
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:07.300
And that's it. So I'll see you

1625
01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:08.100
 all on.

1626
01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:10.700
Wednesday same time.

1627
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:12.200
Take care for now.

1628
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.100
And enjoy the recipe. Bye.

1629
01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:17.600
Thanks, Danny.
