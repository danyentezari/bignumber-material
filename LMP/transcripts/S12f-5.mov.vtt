00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.700
if you remember we said that a

1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.200
neural neural network has a basic component which we call

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 the perceptron and the perceptual is supposed

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.100
 to be a mathematical model.

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.500
of a human brain neuron

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.700
and a neuron will pass a signal.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.400
Forward if the signal is strong enough.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.100
In the context of networks if it's relevant enough the

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.600
 value of function.

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.700
Well established.

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.500
threshold

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.200
so the value is for

12
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.700
setting a threshold.

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.800
Let me show you something else. I did not talk about.

14
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.500
This is slide 108 if I return to 152.

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.900
You will notice we have these arrows.

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.300
These arrows are biases.

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.400
So this is the one x-axis.

18
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.900
And let's say the x-axis is the size of the property.

19
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.400
And the y-axis is the activation.

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200
the strength of the signal so to speak

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.600
so the y axis is the activation.

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.800
This is actually the size of the property times.

23
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.900
the weight

24
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.200
the random weight. So let's say if I come

25
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.000
 back to our slides. I think it was W sub 2i,

26
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.900
 but it's a wait just a wait just

27
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.700
some random weight

28
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.300
Okay.

29
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.900
and here the bias is set to zero,

30
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.400
 which means

31
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.000
It is zero.

32
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.600
so the origin

33
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.600
okay.

34
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.200
if I return to this unbiased activation

35
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.500
 function

36
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.900
I don't like to use the word unbias because it has a specific meanings

37
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.200
 statistics.

38
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.600
but if you look at this activation function here

39
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.100
the bias is set to zero.

40
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.300
So which means that I mean, it's like an if enough statement right

41
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.200
 f of x will give you 0

42
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.200
for any value of x that is less than

43
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.500
 zero. So basically any negative numbers that is negative really is

44
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.700
 going to

45
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.300
squishy to zero

46
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.800
but if any value is equal to zero or above 0

47
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.800
and then you will get a you will get the linear you will get an identity.

48
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.600
 So if you get 5

49
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.100
You basically rally will let it

50
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.900
 through as long as it's above zero.

51
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.400
suppose

52
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.100
this is our

53
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.400
customized value

54
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.300
and then we will say it is the function

55
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.500
 represented by f of x.

56
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.200
And this will be a piecewise function. So begin.

57
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.100
It will give you.

58
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.700
zero

59
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.500
if

60
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.200
the value of x is

61
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.000
greater than

62
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.300
the bias

63
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.500
Excuse me.

64
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.400
Less than the bias.

65
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.300
and it will give you

66
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.300
X

67
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.400
itself

68
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.900
if

69
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.000
it is equal to

70
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.400
basically greater than or equal to the bias.

71
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.000
Like a simple if anal statement.

72
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.900
If it's less than biased.

73
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.900
zero equal to above bias

74
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.600
X letter through

75
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.500
So, let me tell you what device does let me

76
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.900
 ask a question.

77
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.200
how

78
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.100
Big does a property have to be.

79
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.500
What is the minimum minimal size the smallest of

80
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.600
 property has to be for to

81
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.900
 be considered?

82
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.400
Either an office or an apartment.

83
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.400
200 square feet

84
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.600
we will set the bias.

85
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.000
To be good to 200. Basically we are doing this.

86
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.100
If we set the Bice 200, we're going to

87
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.700
 shift this.

88
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.300
200 points to the right

89
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.000
imagine if I bring it over here.

90
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.500
Okay.

91
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.600
We have shifted.

92
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.200
the bias 200 points

93
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.300
Okay, what are we doing here?

94
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.400
Suppose we take we have some property.

95
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.300
And I will use this point to represent that problem. Let's make this a

96
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.400
 very small observation.

97
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.200
Okay.

98
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.100
this represents

99
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.400
the size times weight

100
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.800
of this property

101
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200
if the property is

102
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.600
100 I can't even put it exactly on

103
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.700
 the

104
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.800
property is 150 square feet.

105
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400
Because it is below our threshold.

106
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.900
We don't even consider the property.

107
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.000
So it's activation will be zero.

108
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.400
so

109
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.400
f of x or if you or equivalently if you want five

110
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.900
 of x

111
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.700
I want to be consistent with the slides.

112
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.100
The activation for this particular X will

113
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.500
 be zero.

114
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.400
Because it's not a property.

115
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.100
What if we make it one, you know

116
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.700
 190 still not a property. It's not qualified

117
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.500
 to be a property.

118
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.300
But once it gets to 200 or above. Oh, well, then

119
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.900
 we will let it through.

120
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.400
That's what I mean by strength of the signal.

121
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.200
If we had a stack of hidden layers, it would not even get to

122
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.000
 the next year because what's the point of figuring because see

123
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.700
 the way we're going to determine if it's a office or

124
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.300
 a real estate is to see how big it is how many

125
00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.900
 partitions?

126
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.400
How many windows the height of

127
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.500
 the ceiling may be?

128
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.600
How many fire extinguishers?

129
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.500
How many glass because of Open

130
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.800
 Space is really they have these glass?

131
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.500
Like you don't have well like you have we

132
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.300
 have a beat you have view like glass Glass Walls. I

133
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.800
 don't know how to call it.

134
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.100
So what's the point of counting the number of

135
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.600
 rooms and the height of the ceiling and the number of fire extinguishers if

136
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.400
 it's even if it's too small to even be considered

137
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.000
 an apartment, that's what this value is going to

138
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.200
 do.

139
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.600
So if I return you if I return here to the

140
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.200
slides if I

141
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.400
 return to one five two

142
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.800
That's what we try to indicate it. So if you see here, let's say the

143
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.600
 okay this one this activation function

144
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.600
 for this example. The bias is set to 0.

145
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.800
So when we take this sum of this product 32 because 32

146
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.200
 is above the bias it will we will let it

147
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.600
 through same thing for 55 with letter through but

148
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.900
 for negative four, we crush it down to zero.

149
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.300
then once we get to this point

150
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.400
We will also do we will

151
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.800
 multiply this activation by its weight.

152
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.300
This activation by its weight this activation by its

153
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.500
 weight.

154
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.300
So this one?

155
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.000
Since the signal was very weak.

156
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.100
It will remain zero even when it reaches this

157
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.600
 downstairs. So for example

158
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.900
Let's say this particular property.

159
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.400
has

160
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.100
its size is below the

161
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.600
 threshold.

162
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.200
That's already a red flag. It's not big enough for us

163
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.100
 to consider the property.

164
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.200
but it has a door and it has

165
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:00.800
a window

166
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.500
But because this signal from this perception is

167
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:06.900
 very weak.

168
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.300
And we have another activation function here. We will

169
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.800
 classify it as not property.

170
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.200
but I talked about binary classification, so

171
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.400
I guess it could be.

172
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.300
a very small office

173
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.800
Like, you know when you go to currency exchange.

174
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.600
They have these very small booths. So I guess

175
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.600
 you can call that an office.

176
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.200
The example I'm giving is

177
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.200
 not perfect, but hopefully understand the purpose of the rally function.

178
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.800
 That's really what I'm trying to emphasize you.
