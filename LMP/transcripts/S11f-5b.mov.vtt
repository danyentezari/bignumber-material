00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
And then we have Max pooling. So let me return to the

1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.400
 notes Here.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.900
We will take this sum.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.700
of all of these so

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.000
okay.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.500
That's all a kind of Illusion is.

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.800
the filter

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.500
Is that W vector?

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.300
So where X is the data and the

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.800
 data can be anything pictures?

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.600
Sequence of words prices like in

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.300
 the real estate example and W is the filter now

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.200
 what is a filter? Let me show you picture because that's the best

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.400
 fastest way to make sense of a filter now in order

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.300
 for the model to perceive.

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.900
The number four it must be able to see.

16
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.300
the vertical lines

17
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.200
the horizontal lines and

18
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.400
diagonal lines if any

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.200
If you see here we have how many vertical lines we have

20
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.000
 two vertical lines?

21
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.600
this part of the number four

22
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.700
And obviously this part of the number four.

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.200
And then the one horizontal line.

24
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.200
Is here?

25
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.600
So we will have one filter.

26
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.800
For the vertical lines that is how we will arrange now. They

27
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.800
 don't have they haven't shown you the combination. Like how

28
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.600
 what numbers would you put in the filter? But

29
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.000
I'll show it to you in a minute.

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.800
Anyway, so this will be a matrix the filter Matrix.

31
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.900
And one you convolve this Matrix with

32
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.100
 the original Matrix, you can

33
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.500
 see we'll get the we will get these signals.

34
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.600
So you can see here. We have the number three.

35
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.700
Three's a very strong signal

36
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.900
and two

37
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.700
is a strong but not as strong. But anyway, we

38
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.700
 the model has perceived is

39
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.900
 able to see those two lines.

40
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.700
So they this part corresponds to

41
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.200
 that and by the way, why is this

42
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.400
 three? Well, because when we took a stride here, we saw

43
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.800
 three when you take a stride here.

44
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.500
the signal weakens

45
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.600
And when you come down here the signal weakens even some more.

46
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.400
Right because it's affected by these zeros.

47
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.100
and then

48
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.200
yeah.

49
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.500
These are all three but because we have a completely white

50
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.000
 pixels.

51
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.000
all the way from top to bottom

52
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.900
same thing here for the horizontal lines.

53
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.700
There are there is not a horizontal line so

54
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.200
 to speak because but there is some.

55
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.200
Activity, but it's not strong enough to constitute a line, which

56
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.100
 is why the signal is weak up here.

57
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.800
Here, however, we have would you have a strong signal?

58
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.400
But you have these tools because they're

59
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 affected by these zeros.

60
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.500
And then we have no vertical lines. Excuse me. We have no higher

61
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.900
 than the lines in this part of the Matrix, which is why

62
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.400
The signal is completely weak.

63
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.200
But if you try to visualize this if you want to put these

64
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.400
 two matrices together.

65
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.600
If you were to put these Matrix if I would like to take this three.

66
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.500
And bring it up here.

67
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.300
It would form the number four.

68
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.700
And there's nothing across the diagonal. So this is weak altogether.

69
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.100
kernels also synonymous with filter

70
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.700
Okay.

71
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.400
So for example if you put a five.

72
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.000
In sorry about that if you put a 5 in here.

73
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.200
in the middle

74
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.700
then and negative ones.

75
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.200
In these places, then you're going to sharpen the image.

76
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.100
So when you convolve

77
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.100
this picture with that.

78
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.900
Matrix

79
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.800
the effect will be to sharpen the image you can see we get

80
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.400
 a clear outline of the person's face

81
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.600
 where the eyes are where the lips are. So this

82
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.700
 is going to be easier to classify than the picture on the left.

83
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.200
Okay.

84
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.000
I can look it up and show you what numbers are arranged

85
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.600
 in the filters. So for emboss.

86
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.300
You can see will be two one zero.

87
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.600
You get the idea, right? That's the point.

88
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.600
And then we have Max pooling.

89
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.000
Matrix

90
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.700
of weights to

91
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.400
put in quotation marks perceive

92
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.500
the

93
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.200
what's the what's a good word to use here?

94
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.700
to perceive the

95
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800
outlines for example of the

96
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.000
picture

97
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.800
vertical line vertical

98
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.500
lines horizontal lines
