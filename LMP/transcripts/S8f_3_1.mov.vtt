Say we have a square Matrix a

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.100
 and it's scalar values are two two one. Three

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.300
 two diagonalization. This Matrix

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.800
 is to decompose it.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.500
or factory

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.100
and the factors will be will represent

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.300
 what the following letters a will be

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.800
 the product of three matrices P D and

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.200
 P.

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.100
So let me show you how to get P once we

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.300
 get p we can talk about inversion so we can see how we

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.600
 get this.

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600
So the composition of a will give us these three

13
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 Matrix. So let's see how what are the steps that we need to perform to

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.800
 get to this and through these steps. We will

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.600
 revisit eigenvalues eigenvectors.

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.800
Basis, right? So we want to check

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 the prerequisites before again the p
