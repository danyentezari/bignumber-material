00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.200
So let's say we have a simple two by two

1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.600
 Matrix.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.500
If you remember we talked about this form.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.100
of a matrix

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.500
a x equals B

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.500
Where as a matrix X is equal to a vector

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.400
 and B is a vectors if we multiply the matrix

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.100
 by the vector will get the B Vector now. This is also related to the

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.200
 inverse of a matrix which will come

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.800
 back to momentarily Okay, so

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's say we have this Matrix.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.000
Square Matrix with components 7

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.400
3

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.500
3 and negative 1

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.500
and we want to calculate the eigenvectors for

15
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.300
the square Matrix

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.000
So this is our Matrix a go to take an

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.800
 identity Matrix and multiply by the scalar

18
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.200
 Lambda.

19
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.900
So let's keep this as they

20
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.100
 give it.

21
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.500
Okay.

22
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.000
And then we have the ideal in The Matrix, which we know is one.

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.000
zero zero one

24
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.400
We will then multiply this by Lambda.

25
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.600
if you remember from

26
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.100
the X the axioms of

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.400
a vectors

28
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
we can multiply scalar by a vector we can multiply scalars.

29
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.300
By the way with the Matrix and simply what this will

30
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.400
 do is we will substitute the ones with the lambdas.

31
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.100
So this will be a variation of the identity. Matrix

32
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 will have Lambda across the diagonal.

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800
0 elsewhere

34
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.900
with this combination

35
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.800
we're going to subtract.

36
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.400
from the

37
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.000
original Matrix a

38
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.400
this Matrix that we have created and we will represent this Matrix as

39
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.900
 a as Lambda

40
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.200
 times. I

41
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.700
since I is used to represent the

42
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.700
I did The Matrix we're going to represent this Matrix as

43
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.200
Lambda times I

44
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.100
so

45
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.500
next thing we are going to do.

46
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.900
is subtract from The Matrix a

47
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.300
Lambda

48
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.500
times I

49
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.800
in other words the difference of this Matrix.

50
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.300
and

51
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.700
the given Matrix

52
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.700
Okay.

53
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.300
This is that Matrix.

54
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.400
and this product

55
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.800
is that Matrix?

56
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.200
Okay.

57
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.000
The next thing we are going to do.

58
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.200
Is what the subtract these two is to do

59
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.700
 the following.

60
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.500
We're going to get a third Matrix.

61
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.500
We have seven minus Lambda.

62
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.100
minus 1

63
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.400
minus Lambda

64
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.500
and then of course the other numbers which are three and

65
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.000
three

66
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.600
and this

67
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.600
we will pass as argument to determine it

68
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.700
 function.

69
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.900
So we will take this Matrix.

70
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.900
And then we will take the determinant of this Matrix.

71
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.600
And we've already seen how we can take the determinant

72
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.400
 of a matrix it will be.

73
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.200
The product of these two numbers minus the

74
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.400
 product of these two numbers.

75
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.800
and then we will get

76
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.900
maybe just copy these.

77
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.000
now

78
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.300
if we multiply these numbers together.

79
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.900
We get the following.

80
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.100
expression

81
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.300
Okay, then we solve we are.

82
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.600
You know do some algebra.

83
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.600
So adding the

84
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.400
minus 7 to minus 9 we get

85
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.800
Negative 16, but we also have to make sure.

86
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.400
to bring the terms with

87
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.600
the high order terms to the front. So Lambda squared

88
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.500
 must come here to the front.

89
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.300
And we have minus six Lambda.

90
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.900
And then we get minus 16.

91
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.000
Now here we have.

92
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.400
an unknown variable

93
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.000
that's the eigenvalue. So we need to

94
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.300
 find you have to solve for Lambda here.

95
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.100
Of course, we will Factor these two numbers.

96
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.400
to get

97
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.500
let me make some steps here. So this is a

98
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.200
let's call this step one.

99
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.700
subtract

100
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.100
Matrix a from

101
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.500
not the times I

102
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.400
don't have step two.

103
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.700
solve for Lambda

104
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.000
so I'm going to copy this.

105
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.300
expression

106
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.900
We can.

107
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.300
effectively term so we will get

108
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.600
Lambda

109
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.600
Yeah, Lambda minus 8.

110
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.900
and Lambda plus 2

111
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.500
of course is equal to 0.

112
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.600
And then so we will get that we will

113
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.400
 have two equations not the minus 8 Lambda

114
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.400
 plus 2 if we move them to the other side of the equation this would become Lambda

115
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.000
 equals 8.

116
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.100
Lambda equals to so these are our two eigenvalues.

117
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.200
So let's make this step three.

118
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.100
Let's make this step three two, excuse

119
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.700
 me from my

120
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.900
Handwriting this is why why you use latex to

121
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.000
 avoid?

122
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.600
Having to correct myself continuously step two would

123
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.200
 be yeah step two would be to determinant.

124
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.400
Step 2

125
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.600
would be

126
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.700
determinant of that

127
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.600
so determinant of

128
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.400
that

129
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.500
right

130
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.900
so

131
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.500
By the way, I will write this all down in latex. So you don't

132
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.200
 have to look at this. It's just faster to go to for

133
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.400
 me to hand to this by running.

134
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.300
Now we can do is we can go back to the Lambda times

135
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.800
 I Matrix so this one up here.

136
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.000
We're going to plug in the values for Lambda.

137
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.900
Okay.

138
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.300
As a matter of fact, let me copy this. I'm just going to

139
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.500
 copy this thing.

140
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.500
So we step four.

141
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.300
So first step four we have these two roots.

142
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.000
We can use either one of them. Let's do.

143
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.100
Let's do it first.

144
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.800
Although the solution work for well will work for either one. Both of

145
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.800
 those will give you your eigenvector.

146
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.400
so the step four

147
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.200
So let's just bring this over

148
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.300
 here.

149
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.600
now the determinant the difference

150
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:11.800
of a

151
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.100
and

152
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.900
Lambda terms are times. I

153
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.600
so that's this Matrix. This is that Matrix.

154
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.600
 So we will take one of those numbers.

155
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.200
8 and plug in for these values

156
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.400
So we're gonna I'm gonna copy this.

157
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.200
And to replace lambdas with 8.

158
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.300
We have three.

159
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:36.600
three

160
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.100
this is three and this is negative 9.

161
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.700
it's at

162
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.300
What do we do next we?

163
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.000
we represent this as a

164
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.300
system of equations

165
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.800
so we can find x sub 1 and x sub 2

166
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.200
where x sub 1 and x sub 2 are the values in

167
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.000
 the eigenvector.

168
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.700
So step 5.

169
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.200
find

170
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:27.500
the

171
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:29.900
I get vectors.

172
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.400
eigenvector

173
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.000
single

174
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.300
we have the argument values we can now find the argument vector.

175
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.700
So to do this we are going to create an

176
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.200
 argumented Matrix. So I'm going to take this Matrix.

177
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.800
And we're going to have a square Matrix. Excuse me.

178
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.700
 We're gonna have a vector.

179
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.200
0 0

180
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.100
essentially what this?

181
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.700
Equation represents is the following.

182
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:04.700
we have

183
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.800
we want to solve we want to find the eigenvector. So

184
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.200
 basically

185
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:14.700
the vector

186
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.700
That when we multiply by this Matrix.

187
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.400
gives us

188
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.000
that vector

189
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.300
and so the values of this Vector are unknown and

190
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.100
 we will say x sub 1 and x sub 2

191
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.800
x sub 1 x sub 2

192
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.500
so we have minus 1 x sub 1

193
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:40.800
Plus

194
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.100
3 x sub 2

195
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.900
equals 0

196
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.300
and we have in the second equation 3.

197
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:51.800
3

198
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.400
x sub 1 plus negative 9 x

199
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.600
 up to equal 0

200
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.200
And like we saw in the linear program example, we need

201
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:02.500
 to solve.

202
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.500
these equations or at least

203
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.400
as you know

204
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.300
eliminally one of them

205
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.200
eliminating one of them. Let me show you what elimination means

206
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.700
so I'm going to once again.

207
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.800
We're going to augment the above Matrix.

208
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.100
If you remember what we said about augmenting matrices, so let me

209
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.700
 just copy not gonna make up the whole thing.

210
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.000
When you augment a matrix.

211
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.100
What you do is you you bring these two matrices together and then

212
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.500
 you separate them by some vertical line.

213
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.500
This vertical line means there's an equation.

214
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.400
So everything's the right side is an equation everything.

215
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.700
 The left side are well.

216
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.600
the variables

217
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.400
these are your variables.

218
00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.100
and these are the

219
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.300
the zeros of your equation

220
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.400
What we will then do is use.

221
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.900
the gaussian elimination to find the

222
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.400
 X's

223
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:16.500
so

224
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.600
I'm going to for the time being remove this.

225
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.300
Augmented the augmented part because they're all equal to zero.

226
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:30.600
and

227
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.600
so in order for us to eliminate

228
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.200
this row

229
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.200
Because once we eliminate the first row the second row then

230
00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.600
 we have found.

231
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.700
Then we can solve for.

232
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.100
At least just for just one equation. So to do

233
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.700
 this we are going to take

234
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.600
Row 1 multiplied by three three times R1

235
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.700
and add that to

236
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.200
row two

237
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.500
and the result of this we will override or we will

238
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.000
good inside R2.

239
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:08.900
Okay.

240
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800
So what we're doing is this.

241
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.700
this operation

242
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.600
multiply

243
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.300
3 times negative 1 so multiply 3 3

244
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.500
 we will apply to all the terms.

245
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.400
and this equation

246
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.300
so and we actually remove the augmented Matrix so we don't need to

247
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.200
 worry about this anymore.

248
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.100
This will become negative 3.

249
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.200
negative 3

250
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.600
This will become positive 9.

251
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.100
Add these two.

252
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.200
Well, I can't call them equations anymore. Let me bring back to zero so

253
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.000
 your equations now their equations if we add

254
00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:58.600
 these terms together.

255
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.700
What do we get we get well.

256
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.300
Well, everything becomes a zero.

257
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.500
So the result of this.

258
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.100
Edition

259
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800
this will become this will become the second row.

260
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.700
the second row

261
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.500
in other words after we perform this calcium this

262
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.500
 what we're very simple gaussian step.

263
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.900
calculate elimination step

264
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.200
this Matrix

265
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.400
will become

266
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.200
that Matrix

267
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.500
these becomes zeros.

268
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.300
Now we can plug in these values into the

269
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.800
 equation.

270
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.800
so remember we have x sub 1

271
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400
and x sub 2

272
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.500
and we want to know what these are so to do that.

273
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.500
We're going to say negative 1.

274
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.500
X Plus

275
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.900
3 x squared

276
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.200
and these are the values now.

277
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.100
These are the values of x sub 1 x of the

278
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.100
 because if we multiply this Matrix will put that

279
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:16.300
 vector.

280
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.300
We will get these numbers.

281
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.300
I need to set this to zero and then solve for x sub 1.

282
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.600
And X up to so minus one

283
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.600
 X will become.

284
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.800
or rather what I can do is I can

285
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.000
swap these I can have three x sub

286
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.100
 2

287
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.000
and then subtract

288
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.300
minus

289
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.300
1X to bring this to the other side

290
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.900
So we will have One X.

291
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.300
And we just to simplified the notation. That's just

292
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.300
 and sorry. This will be positive One X.

293
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.200
positive One X

294
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.300
and if we just lose the one because we don't put

295
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.400
 the constant there when it's 1 then X is just equal

296
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:17.500
 to

297
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.400
X is just equal to 3 times x

298
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:24.900
It's up to.

299
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.800
That's except one.

300
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.000
and

301
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.100
well x sub 2

302
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.500
so here we have.

303
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.600
our vector

304
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.700
x sub 1 is equal to 3.

305
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.600
Right if we swap the orders.

306
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.200
We get three X2. Anyway, this is

307
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.900
 this is the this is the correct eigenvector.

308
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.000
Come back up here.

309
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.000
We will have three.

310
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200
so x sub 1

311
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:03.700
x sub 2

312
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.300
now, of course we need to

313
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.200
Do the Matrix times do the vector Matrix Vector

314
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.500
 multiplication in one sense? Rhs right

315
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.300
 hand side is zero. We can always divide by 3 and get back the

316
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:20.300
 original.

317
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:21.600
Yes.

318
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.200
Now to so this is now a we have

319
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.300
 found the eigen we have found the components for the eigenvector.

320
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.400
now

321
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.100
to we know now we need to multiply this so we will multiply these and we will

322
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.200
 get

323
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.400
times 3 and 3 times 1 anyway, skipping

324
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.800
 skipping the most the

325
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.900
 product and some business we will get this.

326
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.600
third vector

327
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.600
which is equal to 24.

328
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.500
and 8

329
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.300
and what's interesting is that we can Factor.

330
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.300
The scalar eight from this Matrix. So this is now B.

331
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.400
So another way to represent this vector.

332
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.600
is to represent it like so

333
00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.000
is to go 8 the scalar multiplied by

334
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.200
3

335
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.100
times 1

336
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.500
and it turns out this is one of the this was one of the values for

337
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.300
 the eigenvalue.

338
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.700
So if you multiply this 8 by 3, we will get 24.

339
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.900
Multiply 8 times 1 obviously we'll get eight.

340
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:33.700
All right.

341
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.000
This is how you calculate.

342
00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.200
The eigenvalues and

343
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.400
 I how you find argument that is not eigenvector for a

344
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:48.800
 2 by 2.

345
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:50.900
very

346
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.100
I don't want to say tedious but you know, you have

347
00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.300
 to first do the difference find the difference.

348
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:02.500
of the

349
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.000
Identity Matrix that is multiplied by Lambda.

350
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.500
Then it will get a third Matrix.

351
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.100
So then you have to take the determinant of that Matrix.

352
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.100
Once you take the term of that Matrix you will then you will get

353
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.300
 this.

354
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.200
expression

355
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.100
and then you have to solve for laptop and you will get two values two

356
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.100
 eigenvalues.
