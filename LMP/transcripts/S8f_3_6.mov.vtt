We said we want to decompose a to the following matrices.

1
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.800
P is going to contain the eigenvectors. So p is

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.300
 the Matrix with eigenvectors.

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.500
as columns

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.700
D will be the Matrix.

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.300
containing

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.900
the eigenvalues for the eigenvectors and

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.600
 P to the power negative 1 is

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.200
 the inversion of the Matrix this minus

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.900
 one business by the way has a very nice explanation and

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.100
 it has to do with division. You see

11
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.400
 we cannot we cannot perform division in linear algebra.

12
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.100
 If you remember the axioms that we talked about. I think

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 we talked about the axioms of vectors not the axioms of matrices. But

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.400
 anyway, the vision is not what you can do what you

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.300
 can do have always multiply.

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
By the you know, one over the

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.800
 value. So for example, if you have a scalar three to

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.500
 cancel it out.

19
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.300
It can multiply it by 1 over 3.

20
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.200
So it basically if you have over three, you can represent it as

21
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.100
 three to the power negative 1.

22
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.500
This is where the this is where the mind is one comes

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.300
 from. So this should be minus 1.

24
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600
We have just solved this.

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.400
We have also actually solved that we actually solve this before

26
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.900
 we did that.

27
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.500
And this I'll show you how it's the I'll remind you how it's done again.

28
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.200
So I'm going to scroll all the way down.

29
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.100
So we will take these together stack them into a matrix and we'll get

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.200
the Matrix p

31
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.700
So that means that a will remain

32
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.100
 what it is. That's a p will be

33
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.200
 the eigenvectors V sub

34
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.500
 1 V sub 2 first eigenvector second eigenvector and

35
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 then D will be the diagonal matrix containing

36
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.300
The eigenvalue so I'm going to set these all to 0 what

37
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.200
 were the eigenvalues again?

38
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.500
One of them was yeah, the first argument value was one and

39
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 the second argue value was four. So this will become one.

40
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.700
and four
