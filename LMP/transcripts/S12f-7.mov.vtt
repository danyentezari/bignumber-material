Let me show you this other slide. This is from another very well at book.

1
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.700
Which I have here on my on my desk. The book

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.000
 is called.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.300
fundamentals of machine learning and predictive data analytics

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.600
this is from

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.600
MIT press again. I'll include the book.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.500
in the references file

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.800
but this is hopefully going to help you understand the concept intuitively

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.100
 suppose we have

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.200
a picture with a triangle in it

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.100
this one

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.900
and we want to know what it is that we're looking at.

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.700
each

13
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.100
perceptron and now we only have one hidden layer. So this is a very

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.900
 simplified example.

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.600
Each perceptron is hidden layer.

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Is going to look at one feature of this picture.

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.800
So for example, if you see here we have.

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.400
One segment of the triangle here. We

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.700
 have another segment of the triangle here. We have another yet another

20
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 segment of the triangle.

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.000
Second here the layer.

22
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.300
Is going to combine the information from the previous end layer.

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.100
And I will say oh we are forming an angle.

24
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.400
So that's one angle form. That's one.

25
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't want to use the word feature, but that is one.

26
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
Part of the picture that this machine learning has discovered.

27
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.400
And the same thing for the second perceptron of the Hidden layer.

28
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.900
And you can see once we pass these two.

29
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.100
And by the way, they're vectors, right? These are

30
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.200
 vectors of the features. We pass this

31
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200
 to the Apple layer. Then the perceptron will put these two

32
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 pieces of puzzles together and I will say okay we're looking at a

33
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.400
 triangle. So this is supposed to be intuitive approach.
