00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.500
new notebook

1
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.800
LP

2
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.200
example

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.500
one

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.300
I would say this is a it would be a good idea for you to follow along

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.700
 by the way to actually type along.

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.300
example one

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200
Okay. So first we're not going to use numpy just

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.000
 yet. We're going to use matplotlib.

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.500
Import if you're using colab this

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
 library is already pre installed.

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.600
So I'm going to go Matt.

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.500
plot lip

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.500
Dot pipelot

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.000
as

15
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.500
PLT

16
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.400
quick question how many of you are familiar with this Library?

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.200
And I've used it if you know it and used it before typing y.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.100
Otherwise type it in the chat.

19
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.800
Okay, fine. Okay. See some questions here. No one

20
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.900
 asks.

21
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.600
Do you don't you want to minimize the objective

22
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.500
 function don't you want to minimize the cost?

23
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.300
No, you're right in this example. We want to maximize the profit.

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.900
Okay.

25
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.600
If we sell these containers we will

26
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.900
 earn.

27
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.300
A sense on the dollar so that that's what we that's

28
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.700
 what we want to know.

29
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.700
There's the cost associated with manufacturing them. And then there is

30
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.100
 the revenue we get from selling them. What is

31
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.800
 how much you will profit?

32
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.400
Okay, of course we can then turn that we can turn this problem around

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 and trying to minimize the objective

34
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.000
 function if it had to with the cost associated with it, but this is

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.800
 about maximizing profit.

36
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.700
Okay.

37
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.700
Okay, everybody knows math problem. I don't need to say much about that. But

38
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.300
 let me go ahead and you know plot this

39
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.500
 problem.

40
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.300
So the first thing I'm going to do is generate a

41
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.800
 list.

42
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.200
of numbers

43
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.700
there is

44
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.100
A method within actually, I made a mistake. We

45
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.500
 do need that part import.

46
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.300
but it's it's just

47
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.900
to produce some to produce some numbers.

48
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.000
Let me import no pi.

49
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.100
So X is going to be equal to NP Dot

50
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.800
 and we're going to produce a linear space.

51
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.300
A line a set of linear set of values.

52
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.400
from 0

53
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.800
that's the starting number.

54
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.200
Two, let's make it 100 and we want

55
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.900
 two thousand.

56
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.200
Numbers in this range. So this is a set of real numbers.

57
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.900
0.1 0.2.

58
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.700
all the way to 1,000

59
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.600
because the way we can produce a line.

60
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.500
on Matlab is to have

61
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.100
a sequence of points a sequence of

62
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.100
 XY points. So we need to trace.

63
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.100
Along the X and Y axis.

64
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.200
so we have X

65
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.100
goes from 0 to 100.

66
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.400
And I'm going to express.

67
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.600
the constraints

68
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.600
as functions of Y

69
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.800
So let me give you the code.

70
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.100
So here we are plotting.

71
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.500
the constraints

72
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.900
as equated obviously not equalities.

73
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.500
How do we get this? How did we get this function? Well if I

74
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.400
 come down

75
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.900
here

76
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.700
It's this one.

77
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.800
What we've done?

78
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.000
Is we have moved 200?

79
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.400
To the right side of the equation so we get 4,000. Obviously. I'm

80
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.000
 not including the million. I I don't want a graph

81
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.400
 that is that large I will label in the

82
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.200
 graph. I will label in the X and Y axis but I'm dropping the

83
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.800
 times the scientific notation from here, but

84
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.200
 it is 100 y equals 4,000 minus

85
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.000
 200 x so 4,000

86
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.100
 - 200 times x

87
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.600
and the to get rid of The 100.

88
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.500
I'm going to divide both sides of the equation.

89
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.100
So if we divide both sides of the equation, let me actually make this

90
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.000
 swine y.

91
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.300
sub 1 and y sub 2

92
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.400
Okay, make it less this confusing.

93
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.900
So to get rid of the 100s.

94
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.200
I'm going to divide both sides of the equation by 100 divide

95
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.700
 this side of the equation with 100 you get y1,

96
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.900
 you get and divide.

97
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.400
This sort of the equation.

98
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.100
You get Y2.

99
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.900
Okay, so I'm really expressing.

100
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.500
These constraints as functions of Y.

101
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400
I'm doing something here.

102
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.700
I'm moving 100 to the right side of the equation. So we get 3,000 minus

103
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.900
 100. So 3,000 minus 100 and

104
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.800
 then of course to get rid of the 100. I'm going to divide both Saturday

105
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.300
 equation, okay.

106
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.200
and then

107
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.300
I need to set the limits of my

108
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.700
 plot.

109
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.600
Math plot, it would automatically set the

110
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.200
 limits of on the X and Y axis, but I want to

111
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.500
 maybe leave some room.

112
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.500
for visualization

113
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.400
then I'm going to plot.

114
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.800
both of these

115
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.600
equations. I'm going to plug both of these.

116
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.700
constraints

117
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.900
this is going to be y sub 1 this will be y sub 2.

118
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.400
Okay.

119
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.700
Going to run this.

120
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.500
So just to make it especially clear. This is

121
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.800
 the first

122
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.500
constraint

123
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.700
so our solution area is limited to

124
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.400
You know this triangular region.

125
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.800
but then when we involve the second

126
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.800
constraint

127
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.300
now well now we're confined to this region.

128
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.900
And you can see we have an intersection in here.

129
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.700
We would have we have just found this we found this by.

130
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.600
Finding the roots in our constraints and

131
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.500
 we find we found out that the point.

132
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.800
On the feasible region is 10 and 20.

133
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.400
So we can take this and we can plot to indicate it.

134
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.300
So whatever our objective function is going to be maximized to it must.

135
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.300
Not leave this area.

136
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.000
Okay, so let me show you what I mean.

137
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.100
and

138
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.300
Let me relabel this one. So for

139
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.200
the first constraint

140
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.000
we have X must be greater than or equal to 0 so X.

141
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.400
Must be greater than or equal to.

142
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.800
0

143
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.500
and then y must be greater than or equal to.

144
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.300
0

145
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.500
so plot

146
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:44.800
the

147
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.600
constraints

148
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.500
This is an equations and this is this was supposed

149
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.400
 to be Express.

150
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.700
Express the constraints

151
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.500
as functions

152
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.200
of Y

153
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:07.900
All right.

154
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.000
Now the point the point that indicates the

155
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.100
 physical region.

156
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.700
We use the plot method.

157
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.400
The point on the x-axis the point on the y-axis.

158
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.000
And then here we could choose the marker and the size of

159
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.400
 the marker and give it a color.

160
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.400
so plot

161
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.500
the point

162
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.100
indicating

163
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.500
a feasible

164
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:42.700
region

165
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:47.800
There we go.

166
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.800
so objective function

167
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.200
must

168
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.700
go through this point.

169
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.000
Okay, so we're getting closer to the solution.

170
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:03.800
and then

171
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.300
let me show you how I can fill in the region.

172
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.400
I can fill in the regions.

173
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.100
So I'm going to there's a method called.

174
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.500
the

175
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.800
field between method

176
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.300
so we have y sub 1

177
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.900
y sub 2

178
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.000
and then we want to plot the region.

179
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.400
that where

180
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.000
the points in our first

181
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.600
 constraint or less than the second constraint again.

182
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.900
 This is what this is what it looks like.

183
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.500
and it did not work because

184
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.600
because

185
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.500
Yeah, because we have okay, this was something else. This was

186
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.600
 supposed to be the masking area.

187
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.500
So before we mask.

188
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.500
Let me actually plot the gray areas. So this will be through between

189
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.700
so shade

190
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:11.800
the regions

191
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.500
under the constraints

192
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.500
So first, we'll do the first constraints. That's

193
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.300
 why I said one.

194
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.600
Which will give us that.

195
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.900
And then I'll pay for the second constraint. So why sub

196
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.000
 2

197
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.300
Okay, and this other plot, let me disable this

198
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.300
 for the second for a second.

199
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.600
We want to get rid of these regions.

200
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.100
So we should only see Gray.

201
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.800
In the feasible region, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to mask.

202
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.300
These areas.

203
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.400
So I'm going to use the fill between method again, but I'm gonna

204
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.800
 set the color to white and the alpha to one.

205
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.700
now I will do this for both of the
