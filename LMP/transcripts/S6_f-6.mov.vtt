00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.300
So I'm gonna do two things. I'm gonna do these

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.500
 steps. I'm gonna draw

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.300
my Vector V1, which is

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.200
 for reference then.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
I'll create a transformation matrix. I'll show you how to create a transformation matrix,

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.300
 by the way.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.000
So I'm gonna create my vectors. I'm gonna go

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.800
 Vector. This is going to be V sub 1

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.400
and it will take us argument a tuple.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.800
So this will be zero 10.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.200
Okay.

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.900
Again, I don't need to pass two tuples because by

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.700
 default it's X and Y displacement is

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.100
 zero anyway.

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.700
I just need to tell where the segment goes where

15
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.800
 the second point is.

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.200
So at that zero ten, this will give me that straight line like

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.300
 before.

18
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.900
Then I'm going to draw this Vector. I'm going to go draw the sub

19
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.400
 one and

20
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.200
I'm gonna go obj = ax and for the

21
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.500
 color just want to make it black.

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.300
Because it's the reference effect vector.

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.200
Okay, make sure the other libraries are

24
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.800
 imported. So I'm going to click on run all.

25
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.300
and then when I scroll down

26
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.600
there was the line now. I want to show you how to rotate this.

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.600
45 degrees

28
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.700
so I'm going to create my rotation Matrix.

29
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.600
And comment that line of code.

30
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.100
And if we look at if we look at the reference.

31
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.100
Up there it says that.

32
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.900
We need to have cosine and sine and

33
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.100
 sign it cosine. So I already

34
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 have the math library in scope.

35
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.400
So I'm going to use math dot cosine. I'll plug

36
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.500
 in the values in a second. Then I have math.sine.

37
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
Then I have math dot cosine.

38
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.400
Whoops sine and then cosine, right?

39
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.000
The cosines go on the main diagonal.

40
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.300
like so

41
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.100
what number should I plug in here?

42
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.600
And this has to be negative.

43
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.000
so

44
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.300
we can't put 90 because well.

45
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.100
We're not an Apollo coordinate system. So yes, we would have

46
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.700
 to convert radian to.

47
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.400
Sorry degree to Radian.

48
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.000
If I show you the polar coordinate system.

49
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.100
Call a coordinate. Of course Pi is the

50
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.500
length of the unit circle

51
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.900
half of that

52
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.500
would be 180 degrees.

53
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.200
So one unit circle is 360 Degrees half of that is

54
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.500
 180. I have a 180 would be a pi

55
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.000
 over 4.

56
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.700
Right, so but let me just pull up the picture.

57
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.800
So Pi the length of the unit circle, so

58
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.600
 three obviously this would be 360.

59
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.000
Zero and 360 are the same.

60
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.400
Pi over 2 is 180.

61
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.500
So half of a unit circle.

62
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.000
And then 1/4 of the unit circle.

63
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.400
So this L shape we get 90 degrees. Our Vector right

64
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.300
 now is here our origin vector.

65
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.100
So we want to go 90 degrees clockwise.

66
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.800
Doesn't matter if you go left or right, but the point is to make it rotate 90

67
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.000
 degrees.

68
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.200
So let me show you two ways to do this.

69
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.200
Converting from the degree to Radiance, so

70
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200
 that would be math.

71
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.500
Dot Pi Pi is a is an attribute of the math

72
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.600
 object over four.

73
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.000
So I'm just gonna take this and I'm gonna call it.

74
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.200
Theta

75
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.000
Oh that pi over 4.

76
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.900
As I meant to put method here.

77
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.100
Okay.

78
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.800
Theta

79
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.300
Theta

80
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.100
Theta data

81
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.300
There's my rotation Matrix. Let me activate this code

82
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.000
 multiply my rotation as against my original vector.

83
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.300
And then if I want to draw my Vector, I'm just going to go.

84
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.100
draw

85
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.100
V1 sub rotate

86
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.200
obj ax and the C. Let's make

87
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.500
 it red.

88
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.800
and

89
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700
I want to use this implementation.

90
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.400
this one

91
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.000
So if you remember we said that if you

92
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.500
 want to convert from Polar to Cartesian.

93
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.200
I mean I already went through this in the start of the session, but

94
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.500
 I want to go the other way around.

95
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.300
So I cannot plug in.

96
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.300
the degrees because we're not in a polar coordinate

97
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.100
 system, so I have to

98
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.800
Convert the other way around now the radiant well obvious.

99
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.500
 It's this but I already know what the length of my Vector is.

100
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.100
 It's just him so R is equal to 10.

101
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.800
But if I want to get my Theta I

102
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 can use arctan. This is the inverse trigonometric

103
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.200
 function. It is denoted arctan or even

104
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.200
 tan to the power y to the power negative 1

105
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.500
So these are these two are identical. Okay, sometimes you will see this notation.

106
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.800
 Sometimes you will use that notation. I'm going to use the archetype

107
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.600
 function to get the Theta.

108
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.600
and together that I'm gonna have to put y over 10, so my Y

109
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.800
 is 10

110
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.100
and my ex is

111
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.900
Well y-axis. Well my x is 0

112
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.100
Okay, so let me show you how I'm going to do this.

113
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.900
All right.

114
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.400
So I'm gonna go.

115
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.500
theta equals math

116
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.300
Dot

117
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.500
arc 10 or 810

118
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.300
and the ratio is y over X. So that's 10 over

119
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.400
 0 what? I cannot divide.

120
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.100
over zero

121
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.300
So, let me just make it converge to 0

122
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300
 make it as close to zero as possible 0.

123
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.100
One, okay. I want to it's just

124
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.800
 an approximation.

125
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.200
This is meant to be cosine.

126
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.800
Okay. There we go.

127
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.500
This is what I was trying to do.

128
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.800
So yes.

129
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.500
I really wanted to show you this implementation because

130
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.300
so that we know we can we can first of all to show

131
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.500
 you the purpose of the inverse trigonometric functions and that

132
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.900
 this is one way we can convert back.

133
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.200
And go we can alternate from Polar quality Cartesian.

134
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.400
And the other solution is the Radian.

135
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.300
The second method is to do it this way.

136
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.800
This is going from

137
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.500
polar

138
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200
to Cartesian

139
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.800
and this is

140
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.300
degree to

141
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.100
Radian

142
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.600
Okay, let's try again.

143
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.700
And of course we want this to be 90 degrees. So I'm gonna make this

144
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.100
 pi over it.

145
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.200
There we go.
