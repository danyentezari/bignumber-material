00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.400
so linear transformation

1
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.400
is a function

2
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.200
here we use a here using map notation.

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.300
So f is a function that goes from RN to RM.

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.600
now a linear transformation can take you from

5
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.700
R3 to R3 or R3 to

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.000
 R2

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.300
so you can actually go from three point to two points or three points to three points

8
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.400
 you can

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.900
changing transformations

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.300
Now this will a linear transformation holds or a

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.500
 linear transformation is a linear transformation if these two conditions hold.

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.300
For example, we have two vectors UV and V.

13
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.500
Then if you take the sum.

14
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.400
of two vectors and remember from abstract from

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.900
from tutorial 8

16
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.700
We talked about the following. Let me copy this.

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800
Paste it on top. This is from the other tutorial.

18
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
And thank you Richard for correcting me on this killer multiplication. So

19
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.600
 I confuse scale a multiplication.

20
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.300
I call a matrix multiplication when I was really referring to the dot

21
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.400
 product.

22
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.100
anyway

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.200
we said that the sum of two vectors will also be

24
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.800
A third Vector, which means whatever this is, let's say

25
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 we get a vector W that will also be an element

26
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.000
 in V. So it's good two vectors give you a vector.

27
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.200
A scalar multiplied by Vector gives

28
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 you a vector.

29
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200
and the dot product

30
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.900
which is and this is how you perform a DOT product just multiply the

31
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.500
 elements of both

32
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.900
 vectors.

33
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.800
Take their sum and you will get the inner product.

34
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.400
We'll be a vector.

35
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.900
so

36
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.300
the sum of the two vectors, which will be a vector must be equal

37
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.400
 to

38
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.300
that transformation

39
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.700
of the

40
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.700
of each vector

41
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.400
separately

42
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.000
I mean exactly what you're seeing here.

43
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.300
This condition must hold for addition. And of course this condition for

44
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.200
 scalar multiplication must hold.

45
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.400
So for me to elaborate, let's consider these two examples.

46
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.700
So here's a here's an example of a transform linear

47
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.900
 transformation.

48
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.300
Okay, no particular reason for using uppercase by the

49
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.600
 way, but let's say this is the least so this is map notation.

50
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.000
 This is function notation.

51
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.000
So is this a we want to see if this is

52
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.300
 a if this is a if this function could be a linear

53
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.000
 transformation for two vectors, of course, these are two elements of a

54
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.400
 vector but it's still applies

55
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.700
 for vectors as well.

56
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.200
here if we take

57
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.200
and just to avoid confusing the

58
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.400
 variables because it's variable can

59
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.100
 also stand for the sum of two variables. Let me use a

60
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.900
 different letter here.

61
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.000
for example

62
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600
I will use let's use U.

63
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.500
Okay. So, let's see if this is an example if this is if this

64
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.400
 is a lean transformation so you we will replace with X

65
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.500
 Plus Y X Plus y

66
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.200
So this one argument will be you.

67
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.300
Well X Plus y squared so if we

68
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.400
 substitute X Plus Y into U will get X Plus y squared.

69
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.600
Which will give us this.

70
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.000
You know.

71
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.700
quite Relic expression

72
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.900
now if we take f of x and F of Y separately

73
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.400
f of x will give us x squared.

74
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.900
So we replace x with u?

75
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.300
And for wide replace you with Y or give

76
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.900
 us x squared plus y squared and clearly this expression

77
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.700
 and that expression are not equivalent.

78
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.500
So this is not a linear transformation.

79
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.400
This is an example of a function. That will

80
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.600
 be a linear transformation.

81
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.600
Well, and how do you prove that? Well, you must evaluate right

82
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.000
 you must.

83
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.300
Take X and Y over 2.

84
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.800
And then to take f of x of this value and

85
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.200
 then if y of this value, but anyway if you do the algebra.

86
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.900
You will see that.

87
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.900
They will be equivalent. So what I'm trying to say is this

88
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.300
G of again, I'm gonna substitute x with a

89
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.200
 huge to avoid any confusion if we would

90
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.000
 take x g of x

91
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.700
plus y

92
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.300
and then we do some algebra.

93
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.000
Dot if you do the algebra, it will turn out that G Plus X.

94
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.500
plus G Plus y

95
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.500
are equivalent

96
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.900
now, of course

97
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.500
Both of these conditions must true must hold true, okay.

98
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.200
So you have to check for that and check for this.

99
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.200
Let's look at an example of a linear transformation and also matrices

100
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.600
 can be

101
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.300
We can also do linear Transformations on matrices.

102
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.800
So let me also add this comment.

103
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.900
This idea of matrices as linear transformation will come.

104
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.500
Into play once we talk about once we return

105
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.300
 to the topic of systems of linear equations.

106
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.400
and of course computer vision

107
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.400
So our discussion today has applications and finance.

108
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.700
and

109
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.100
computer Visionary later on

110
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.100
when we get to a neural networks.

111
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.800
It was everything by the way a new network is a matrix.

112
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.800
Everything in neural networks, and neural networks are

113
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.200
 the infrastructure for deep learning.

114
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.500
It's all Matrix operations. We're going to look at we we're

115
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.800
 going to look at a matrix operation

116
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.300
 that we haven't talked about like the chronicle product

117
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.700
 the kind of evolution.

118
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.800
Which is another way of multiplying two matrices together.

119
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.000
But we'll talk we'll get that later. So here's an example

120
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.700
 of a matrix.

121
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.800
As linear Transformations, okay.

122
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.200
we have a times X plus b, so imagine we have

123
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.200
 a

124
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.600
system of linear equations

125
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.500
here B

126
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.400
Is what the equations equal to?

127
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.200
so if you remember from linear program we had

128
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.400
I think 2x plus y equals 4000.

129
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.500
So anything's developed rights are the equation would be in there

130
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.700
 in the in the B vector.

131
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.400
anyway, if you see here we have two we have

132
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.800
 a matrix The Matrix a

133
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.200
which is a 2 by 3 Matrix and the vector.

134
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.800
Which is well.

135
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.600
Three-dimension. It's it's we have three dimensions three points multiply this

136
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.000
 Matrix and we go from

137
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.300
three vectors to objective with

138
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.300
 three elements to a vector with with two elements

139
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.500
 from R3 to R2.

140
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.400
Okay, we will use we will very soon build upon

141
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.600
 this.

142
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.500
And return to it once we look at more elaborate

143
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.600
 computer vision applications.

144
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.300
So today we will work with the vectors.

145
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.100
Later on, we will work at met with matrices.
