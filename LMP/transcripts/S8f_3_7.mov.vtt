00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.300
the inverse of a matrix

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.200
trying to get a bigger picture. There we go. Imagine. This is

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.900
 p

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.300
And we want to invert it.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.500
To invert this Matrix. We argument the whole Matrix with

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.800
 the identity Matrix. Why because we need

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.600
 to keep track.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.300
of the

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.700
elimination process procedures

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.100
so this will become your

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.800
elimination Matrix

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.100
If you remember from Led composition that the L

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.400
 Matrix.

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800
Is the result of all of the elimination matrices and each

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.500
 elimination Matrix is going to contain one.

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.300
gaussian elimination step

16
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.400
So here, for example, we have how many steps to.

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.400
We take the difference of row two and Row 1

18
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.900
 plug get into row two.

19
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.700
We check Row one multiplied by three attitude Row three replace

20
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.100
 Row three.

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.000
So we go through a series of gaussian elimination, and we know

22
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.500
 that we have eliminated the Matrix once our original

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 Matrix looks ends up

24
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.700
 in row reduce row Echelon form.

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.500
you can see we've gone from

26
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.800
you know this leading one leading one and Lead leading minus

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.300
 three two getting

28
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.600
once all the across the diagonal

29
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.900
but look what has happened to the original ident Matrix.

30
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.600
And as all of these components, what are these components?

31
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.900
all of the combinations

32
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800
for eliminating this Matrix this

33
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.200
Is p to the power negative 1?

34
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.900
This is the inversion.

35
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.100
of that

36
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.000
so the Matrix a

37
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.300
can be decomposed into these

38
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.200
 three matrices three matrices multiplying again,

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.400
 and you will get the original Matrix.

40
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.300
in the context of

41
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.600
SVD this

42
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.100
eigenvalue is going to these this Matrix of

43
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.500
 eigenvalue is going to be very important.
