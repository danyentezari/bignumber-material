00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.900
now let's talk about

1
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.800
linear programming

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.700
linear programming is very close to

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.800
 linear algebra.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.300
And it has this primary component called The

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.000
 Objective function. It's just a

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.300
function

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.800
mmm, but

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.400
the point here is to either maximize the function or

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.900
 minimize the function given some constraints.

10
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.700
So for example, let's say you want to transport.

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.600
Or let's use the shipping, you know like in

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.200
 e-commerce.

13
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.000
and

14
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.200
there are some constraints that have to do

15
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.300
 with petrol consumption.

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.000
the distance traveled the weight of the ships

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.100
the distance to

18
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.200
the recipients so you have these different constraints and you want to

19
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.600
select the parameters.

20
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Such that you're within what we call a feasible region.

21
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.300
I'll show you I'll show you an example of this. I'll show

22
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.300
 you both the mathematics and the graphical.

23
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.800
Explanation because graphing is

24
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.100
 actually a big part of linear programming especially graphing

25
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.200
 any qualities. Like I said linear algebra

26
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.900
 is a subset of abstract algebra and abstract algebra is

27
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 a development or develops takes the

28
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.700
 ideas from classical algebra further.

29
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.300
also part of classical algebra

30
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.600
is functions and graphing them.

31
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.300
In when it comes to vectors in

32
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.800
 particular.

33
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.100
One technique that we will look at which has applications in.

34
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.500
computer vision and natural language processing by

35
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.200
 the way a central

36
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.600
One of the things that we be working towards is

37
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.400
 neural networks.

38
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.200
So this is kind of it's also machine learning part of this

39
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
 course machine understanding machine, but neural electric

40
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800
 specifically not supervised and unsupervised learning.

41
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.600
Will be working with vectors.

42
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.700
So we want to apply techniques like cosine similarity, which I

43
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.400
 said has applications both an image recognition and NLP.

44
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.100
But a prerequisite for understanding Vector operations

45
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.300
 is trigonometry.

46
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200
And trigonometry in turn has geometry as a prerequisite.

47
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.900
what I'm trying to say is this

48
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.100
if you've ever enrolled in a course.

49
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.500
Or picked up a book called linear algebra. It is

50
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.300
 assumed that you know all four

51
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.800
 of these at least the extent.

52
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.900
That would allow you to.

53
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.800
read that book or

54
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.600
complete that course successfully

55
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.100
what we will what I have done in this course is I

56
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.300
 have

57
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.200
made supplementary material for all

58
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.700
 four of these

59
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200
So for example if we come across a word like a vector space.

60
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.200
The word space comes from abstract algebra, and if you do not know what that is

61
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.300
 because you have to know what that is. If you want to make progress.

62
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.200
 Well, then you can refer to the supplementary material.

63
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.400
Which talks about words like spaces?

64
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.200
And the Axiom is that apply to such a type

65
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.700
 of set a space is a type of set.

66
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.100
And of course in order to understand the axioms then apply

67
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.100
 through those sets. You need to know some classical algebra, but

68
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.600
 nothing difficult. It's very straightforward. In fact, we can cover

69
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.700
the key Concepts here today

70
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.800
And then there is trigonometry trigonometry is a big deal again because

71
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.600
 of vectors.

72
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.100
You know must be.

73
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.400
I mean, what are the applications of vectors whether it's

74
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.600
 computer vision or even in even PC by

75
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.300
 the way, you just vectors?

76
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.200
If we wanted we want to know how close they are to each

77
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 other.

78
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.000
So we need to understand angles.

79
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.600
The sign and cosine functions and for that we need to understand so

80
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.700
 basic geometry or at least the notation geometry.

81
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.100
This again will be provided.

82
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.400
a supplementary material

83
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.600
So let me this is an example of Neo program. Let me give you a pictorial

84
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.900
 representation.

85
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.400
and then I will take you to

86
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.500
markdown

87
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.400
because through this exercise we will get a sense of what systems

88
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400
 of linear equations are which is from linear algebra and

89
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.100
The objective function which is linear program, so, you know.

90
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.900
We learned two things with one example.

91
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.000
We have some.

92
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.600
function that we need to optimize to optimize means

93
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.800
 to

94
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.600
At least pictorially graph it so that it satisfies

95
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.500
 all of our four constraints. So we have these four constraints. So

96
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.100
 yeah and this function let's particular function that we

97
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.400
 talked about has two variables. Okay. So put differently.

98
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.000
 It's a function of two variables two things two variables will

99
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.300
 affect.

100
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.900
It's maximization or minimization. Let's because

101
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.500
 I know hypothetical example the price

102
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.500
 of a smartphone.

103
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.400
It could be a function of the size of the screen.

104
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.300
and

105
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.600
How much memory it has rather mattress memory?

106
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.800
Or what's another example salary?

107
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.400
It could be a function of

108
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.600
How many years of experience you have?

109
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.800
And how many years you've spent in in school so academic?

110
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.600
Experience and work experience. Okay, so

111
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.400
 that's salary will be of than we say

112
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.800
 that salaries a function and it's a function of two things.

113
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.900
Anyway here. We have a function. That is a

114
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.200
Whose variables are X and Y both X and Y Must Be

115
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.400
 0.

116
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.900
So if we see here.

117
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.900
If we graph the inequality for X 0 x greater

118
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.200
 than 0 then everything in the right quadrant.

119
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.900
In the first quadrant and the lower quadrant

120
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.500
 would be highlighted.

121
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.400
Okay, so anything there is X anything there

122
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.700
 is equal to or that's an inequality. I hope the pictures

123
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.900
 are very clear, but that's an inequality and it includes zero.

124
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.300
It's a restrict inequality. So anything from zero or

125
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.100
 above X will be shaded.

126
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.000
then we have y

127
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.600
must be above 0 right so Y is this vertical axis

128
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.300
 anything about anything from 0 or above will be highlighted?

129
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.700
But now we have two constraints if we take these two constraints together.

130
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.800
then

131
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.900
if we just focus on these two then how do we satisfy both

132
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.500
 of these constraints? Well,

133
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.000
the Shaded area must be above

134
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.400
The origin for why?

135
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.500
and

136
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.200
To the right of X. So in other words we will have

137
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200
 this region that's

138
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.600
basically slicing

139
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.800
the Shaded area

140
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.000
But then there's more.

141
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.400
Here we have this other inequality.

142
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.800
2x plus 5 y less than or equal to 3,500 which

143
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.200
 gives us this inequality. This it gives us this graph.

144
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.600
So not only does our solution must be in the right quadrant

145
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.300
 in the first quadrant.

146
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.800
And we also have this, you know vertical this diagonal line

147
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.500
 cutting through it.

148
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.100
So if we have this coordinate it was also sliced it from here.

149
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.800
and then there's this fourth quadrant long story short we

150
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.200
 must

151
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.800
perform

152
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.400
arithmetic operations on these two these

153
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.500
constraints which are inequalities

154
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.500
until we find the roots. And once we find the roots of

155
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.400
 these equations, we will then have found the feasible

156
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.300
 region of

157
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.400
our objective function
