Okay. Now I want to show you what happens when I

1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.400
 multiply L by U. This is the original Matrix. This

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.400
 is the L Matrix now the upper Matrix. The U

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.000
 Matrix is the

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.400
Matrix after we

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.600
eliminated everything below the lower triangle. So

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.600
 that was this one.

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.400
I'm not going to scroll up because I have it right here.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.600
array

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.500
So after we solve The Matrix a we

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.000
 get one.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.100
two negative 3

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.300
and then we have zero.

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.800
to

14
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.300
4

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.600
and then 0

16
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.000
0

17
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.400
and this would be seven.

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.600
okay, the idea is this If I multiply

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.200
these two matrices together I should get it back.

20
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.300
the original Matrix

21
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.800
Yeah, now we have the same Matrix.

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.900
Okay, so one two negative three one two negative 3.

23
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.300
and I can even neck convert this to and

24
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.100
Integer by using the as-type method, so I'm going

25
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.500
 to go ask type make this an image integer.

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.200
There we go. So now we have the same Matrix as we had about.

27
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.700
You know one to negative 3 1 to negative 3 3 4 yeah.

28
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.300
But my point was this to summarize.

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.200
What we can do is we can take a square Matrix.

30
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.600
and

31
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.600
factorize it into two matrices.

32
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.900
the lower Matrix which is

33
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.000
The combination of the elimination matrices

34
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.600
 we just saw.

35
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.700
And then once you eliminate eliminate eliminate you get to the upper

36
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.300
 triangle Matrix.

37
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.500
So we need elimination of matrices

38
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.600
 to get to the almatrix.

39
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.300
And once we get to the other Matrix, you would have also acquired the U Matrix.
