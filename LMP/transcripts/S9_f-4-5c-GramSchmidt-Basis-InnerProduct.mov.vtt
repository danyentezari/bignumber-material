00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.800
If you return to our tutorial.

1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.700
We now need to orthogonalize.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.200
80a so we need to make an orthogonal Matrix.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.700
Either way, there are this is there there are

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.200
 a few algorithms with which we can orthogonalize or even

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.700
 orthonormalize a matrix this Matrix in particular.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
And that is called a gram Schmidt.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
Algorithm, so let me show you the Grammy Schmidt algorithm.

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.100
Let me add one thing before I return here.

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
So this is the this is how you denote

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.600
 the dot product. This is one way

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.900
 to do it.

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.600
This dot here.

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.900
Another way to denote it is like so to use

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.700
 the vertical brackets.

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.400
So either this one or

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.600
to do this

17
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.600
two if you see this notation.

18
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400
that's the same thing as that that

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.600
both of these are

20
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.400
you know dot product.

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.100
You call it can call this dot product because there's a dot in here you can call this

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.000
 inner product because well.

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.400
They're inside the brackets.

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.500
I come here you will see.

25
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.700
that

26
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.700
and in other examples they use a brackets.

27
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.500
Anyway, let's see what's going on in here.

28
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.900
Say you have

29
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.600
a basis

30
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.000
basis we said bases.

31
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.700
as two conditions

32
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.400
first of all

33
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.400
So this is this is this this is the basis. This

34
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.900
 is a set.

35
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.300
It has vectors V1 V2 VN.

36
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.400
All three vectors must span the Subspace. What's the Subspace

37
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.900
 RN?

38
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.800
So let's say we talk about a three-dimensional space.

39
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.500
So we need three points. XYZ each

40
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.300
 Vector must have x y z

41
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.200
You can have one that's two Dimension. Another one. That's

42
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.400
 four dimensions. All three must be of the same Dimension that's condition. Number

43
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.600
 one.

44
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.700
Condition number two. They must be independent. What does

45
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.300
 it mean for two vectors to be in two vectors

46
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.700
 to be independent?

47
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.300
It means that when you take the linear combination and the linear combination

48
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.800
 is this so let's say you have two vectors.

49
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.200
And you have to scalars.

50
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.500
Multiply this scalar without Vector multiply

51
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.200
 that's gonna but I back here at the product. It will be

52
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.000
 equal to zero. We saw this in another example. We saw this in the last session.

53
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.700
So that's what a basis is. Okay for now,

54
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.800
 just imagine it's just a matrix.

55
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.900
If you would to put these three columns inside.

56
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.100
If we would take the components of these vectors inside angle brackets,

57
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.000
 it will be a matrix. So for not consider this

58
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.000
 to be a matrix column one column two column three.

59
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.100
How do we orthogonalize?

60
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.500
You define a new variable or new Vector W sub

61
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.600
 1?

62
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.100
And that is just identical to V sub

63
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.300
 1.

64
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.400
with components or with points if you like 110

65
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.500
Then you will use the first Vector W sub

66
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.900
 1 to create a new Vector W sub 2.

67
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.300
How do you create W sub 2?

68
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.400
You take Vector 2.

69
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.500
And subtract it from this ratio.

70
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.100
So you have the dot product of V2 and

71
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.200
the first vector

72
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.600
over the dot product

73
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.900
of the first vector

74
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.800
I mean exactly as you see it here.

75
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.000
This will become the first Vector of

76
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.000
 the new Matrix.

77
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.200
This will become the new Vector of the second Matrix.

78
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.600
this

79
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.500
the new Vector of the third Matrix

80
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.500
so you must multiply the scalar value.

81
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.400
by the components of this third vector

82
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.100
If you do this multiplication if you want if you do the scalar product.

83
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.700
it gets 0

84
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.600
so in

85
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.700
Total we will get.

86
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.000
Yes, we'll get a new Matrix.

87
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.200
So the original Matrix was 1 1 0 1 2 0

88
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.800
 0 1 2 this new Matrix will be.

89
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.600
This will be its first column.

90
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.300
This will be its second column.

91
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.400
This will be its.

92
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.300
third column

93
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.600
Now this is orthogonalization actually.

94
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.100
So these are the vectors.

95
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.800
of The orthogonal Matrix

96
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.300
These are the vectors after it has been normalized.

97
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.500
If we take the square root of 2 over 2, so that's two over.

98
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.100
You can see.

99
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.300
It is 0.7. What I'm trying to say is none

100
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.900
 of these components.

101
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.300
the squared over to

102
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.600
any of these components are above one. So when

103
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.900
 we normalize a vector

104
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.300
None of the points in that Vector exceed one. There will

105
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.100
 be between 0 and 1.

106
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.000
if the notation is a little too overwhelming and it kind of

107
00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.100
 is

108
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.100
Let me simplify by taking a huge back to

109
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.200
 colab.

110
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.700
Okay.

111
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.300
So let's actually use this as an example.
