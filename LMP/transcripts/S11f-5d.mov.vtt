00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.300
And to save time I'm just going to copy paste.

1
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.600
aligned

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.300
so first we have

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.500
we're going to add a carnival kind of evolutional 2D

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.600
 layer.

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.900
This will act.

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.400
this

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.700
stack that we adding this kind of 2D.

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.700
Let me put them on Triple line. So we know what these arguments are.

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.200
So this is for the input layer.

10
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.800
Which corresponds to the this dimensions of

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100
 the picture with height and color channels?

12
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.600
so input

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.600
of the model

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.400
we have with height and

15
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.900
number of color channels

16
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.300
This is

17
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.200
 the activation function and I guess we haven't talked about

18
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.000
 this. We will just have to do it in the next session.

19
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.100
Activation function and I will

20
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.700
 show you the tensorflow playground.

21
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.500
If I showed you pictureally you will get the point.

22
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.900
This is the size of the filter.

23
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.300
And this is this number of filters you have.

24
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.200
32 64

25
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.800
I'm graph filters.

26
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.400
So you can take any Carnival 2D layer.

27
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.200
And activate this argument input shape and this will

28
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500
 in fact become the input layer and the first Carnival 2D

29
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.700
 layer.

30
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.000
that we will use max pool d

31
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.500
Max pool two dimensions

32
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.200
again, that's the size of the filter.

33
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.400
This is the size.

34
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.500
Excuse me.

35
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.300
This is the size of the

36
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.600
size of the max pulley

37
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.700
Matrix

38
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.300
Number of filters of the same number as kernels. No, we

39
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.300
 use filters and curls interchangeably.

40
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.300
So what you're asking here is now is the number of photos

41
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.100
 the same number of filters.

42
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.500
Filters and kernels we use interchangeably.

43
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.100
Okay.

44
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.200
And then we have another carnivore to kind of 2D layer.

45
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.100
So I'm gonna copy paste.

46
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.900
Because what we want to do.

47
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.100
If I bring you back to this diagram.

48
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.000
here

49
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.200
imagine what we do is we take our original picture.

50
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.700
and we use a

51
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.200
we convolve it with the filter.

52
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.100
And then we get this outline image.

53
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.300
From this outline image we will get the max pool.

54
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.300
 We'll get the strongest activations, but we still want to

55
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.000
 further.

56
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.100
identify the important

57
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.600
patterns in this picture

58
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.100
so

59
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.900
This is not exactly the max pool layer. But imagine

60
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.000
 it is the max pool layer. All we want to

61
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.600
 do is take this.

62
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.000
And further decompose it.

63
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.600
Because you can see in this picture.

64
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.200
It is clear that it is ahead at least to

65
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.200
 us, but it can be clear or still.

66
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.900
So we can for example.

67
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.200
We have some.

68
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.600
Shade of green the forehead some Darkness on

69
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.200
 the left side of the face some brightness on the

70
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.100
 dark side of the face. So we want to call the convolve this again Max

71
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.600
 pull it to further to further,

72
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.100
 you know, make it clear that this is a

73
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.600
 face and even remove the background.

74
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.500
That's the point here.

75
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.200
Now the correct combination of how many Carnival 2D layers you

76
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.000
 need how many Max pulley Max pool layer. You

77
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.400
 need really depends on

78
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.900
experimentation

79
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.500
you would try this configuration first. Look at

80
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.800
 the metrics. Is it good?

81
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.500
Perfect continue. Otherwise, you will go back and up

82
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.700
 change the hyper parameters. So these are all.

83
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.300
These are hyper parameters that we have here.

84
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.700
The number of voltage you choose is one hyperparameter. The

85
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.600
 size of the filter is another private parameter the size

86
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.600
 of the structure. The number of strides is not a hyper parameter. So there

87
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.800
 are some experimentation involved.

88
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.300
Okay. Anyway, let me go and copy this finish this code

89
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.800
 because we won't have 12 minutes left.

90
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.300
So conf 2D we then

91
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 use max pool again, and then one more convolutional layer.

92
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.000
We don't need the marks Max pool here that we will flatten it.

93
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.000
I've surely what flight does it from the slides in?

94
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.500
in

95
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.700
from module 1

96
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.800
and then we have

97
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.400
I'm not sure we'll be able to talk about.

98
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.100
the loss function which is

99
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.700
something called cross entropy

100
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.300
and for us to understand the soft Max.

101
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.000
activation function

102
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.700
we would need to talk cover some probability.

103
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.500
There's something called probability. There is something called the odds.

104
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.900
was the ratio of two probabilities because for

105
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.100
 the activation function

106
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.700
In particular softmax function and the

107
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.100
 loss function there were about to use me. We need to cover some.

108
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600
probability Theory

109
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.200
the reason we have this flat layer.

110
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.800
Is to turn this Matrix into one

111
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.400
 vector where the vector will represent the distribution.

112
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.300
whether it's sound bites whether it's pictures, whether

113
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.800
 it's characters, whether it's

114
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.500
clusters

115
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.500
no matter what the

116
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.500
Modality of the data if you remember we talked about the modality we

117
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.000
 said there are different ways to perceive data sound vision.

118
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.600
No matter what the modality of the data.

119
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.100
Ultimately, whatever the nature of

120
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.400
 the data is it will turn into a distribution.

121
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.500
a distribution is this

122
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.600
everything must ultimately turn into one of these and the

123
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600
 shape of this.

124
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.300
The shape of the distribute the word distribution

125
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.400
 really mean shape of the data.

126
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.600
So the shape of the data will determine what?

127
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.400
This thing is so for example if the distribution

128
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.500
 is skewed, right?

129
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.200
It's skewed right when it when you have this downward this

130
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.400
 tail that goes all to the right. So for

131
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.000
 example, let's say if it's skewed right then it's a cat.

132
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.800
If it's centered, it's a car.

133
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.900
If it's bimodal, this is a bimodal distribution.

134
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.000
Like this. It's a truck.

135
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.400
So what the model we see is this it

136
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.800
 cannot see colors it cannot see words. It

137
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.000
 cannot hear sounds what I can see is these distributions and

138
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.600
this is just

139
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.200
numbers that are plotted

140
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.500
but let me just show you one more thing just to get my point across with this

141
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.500
 flattened layer.

142
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.000
So you have your image?

143
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.200
comes in three color channels

144
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.700
At the end what we're going to do is gonna flood it. This will become a distribution so

145
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.300
 you can see here in the right.

146
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.800
We can see the distribution of colors.

147
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.300
So all of these pictures that you see up here, they will all have

148
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.500
 their own distinct fear distributions.

149
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.300
That's it.

150
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.500
This densely then.

151
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.100
This one down here in particular.

152
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.300
Is to give us the 10 possible classes to which the

153
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.800
 particular picture belongs in order. So

154
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.000
 we will have the top

155
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.400
 10 classes. We only have 10 classes anyway, but it

156
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.300
 will give you the top 10 classes in order of higher probability.

157
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:48.900
And that's it.
