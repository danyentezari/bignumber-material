00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.300
so to do this we need to

1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.400
Convert from Polar to coordinate system.

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
if you remember how we started our session today, we we said

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.600
 that

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.500
we put a point on the Cartesian space.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.500
And in math, we just draw a line, but in Python, we

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.900
 have to create a sequence of points leading up to that point.

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.900
so for example five steps are along the x-axis

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.000
 and then five steps along the y-axis and

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.700
that's where we put the point and then we draw a line leading to that point.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.600
But if you notice here when we do draw this Vector we have now formed

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.000
 an angle.

12
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.700
We have formed an angle from the x-axis to

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.900
 the

14
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.400
to the line

15
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.500
There's a word for this I think there's initial side and

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.200
 the terminal side. So this is the initial side.

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.100
Relative to the x-axis is the initial side. That's the terminal side

18
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.100
 relative to the y-axis. That would be the initial side. And

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.900
 this would be the terminal side. And

20
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.800
 anyway, so on the Cartesian coordinate

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.000
 system, we have the values X and Y and that produces the

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.100
 point.

23
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.700
in the polar coordinate system we have

24
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.300
R which is the radius

25
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.500
And the coordinate the polar coordinates is

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800
 a circle. We'll see this in a second and the angle of theta.

27
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.100
So if you know these values if you know the the length of the

28
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.600
 vector.

29
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.400
and it's

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Angle from the initial side, then you will know its position

31
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.200
 on the polar coordinate system, but there's a way we can convert we can

32
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.000
 go from one system to another system.

33
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
Let me show you the polar coordinate system on its own polar coordinate

34
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.700
 system.

35
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.900
Okay.

36
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.100
These are the coordinates.

37
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.400
on the

38
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.200
Holocaust system, obviously

39
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.400
the point one point would be the length of the vector that

40
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.800
 will always be the case and then

41
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.400
there is radian. And what's the other one? Yeah in

42
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 Radiance how how far it

43
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.900
 is from the initial side.

44
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.000
Okay.

45
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.900
And this is the radian system.

46
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.500
You get the idea hope?

47
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.200
okay, so if you want to for example go from

48
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.900
 Polar to

49
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.700
Cartesian you calculated this way.

50
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.200
We go X will be equal to R.

51
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.700
Which is the radius?

52
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.200
times

53
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.900
Yeah sign of the angle Theta.

54
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.200
and if you want the Y you multiply by

55
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.100
the cosine

56
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.500
Theta

57
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.700
This is how you convert.

58
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.100
We know have the angle Theta for our cosine similarity

59
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.400
 now. We just need to multiply it. But

60
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.700
 well we need to

61
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.300
Calculate the sign of that.

62
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.500
Angle which will give us the ratio.

63
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.300
for sine, it will be the ratio will be

64
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.900
opposite over hypotenuse, right?

65
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.700
And cosine would be yeah, I just over hypotenuse.

66
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.800
So if I want the X and Y from my cosine similarity, I'm

67
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.500
 going to come back to my notebook.

68
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.400
I will call this.

69
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.100
Cos or see Sim one

70
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.700
 cosine similarity for the first comparison.

71
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.500
Cosine sub let's make it one and two right the

72
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.100
 cosine similarity of vectors 1 and 2 the cosine

73
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.300
 similarity of vectors.

74
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.800
Two and three or let's make this one and three.

75
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.000
to convert

76
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.400
to Cartesian

77
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.400
now

78
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.200
we cannot plot these wood vectors because we have

79
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.800
 to project this in the two-dimensional space. These are four dimensional. So

80
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.000
 what we're going to do is we're going to

81
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.100
 create two vectors that go from all from 0

82
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.800
 to 5. Basically, let me show you what I mean. Okay, so

83
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.100
I'm going to create those three vectors again that this be

84
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.600
Five five okay five steps from the x-axis five

85
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.500
 steps to the y-axis.

86
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.100
Let me go back to what I had before.

87
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.900
I need to be more careful.

88
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.100
Okay, so that's the let me let me let me make the vector a

89
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.200
 bit longer. So we'll go from 10 to 10.

90
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.800
Now after we have calculated the cosine similarity.

91
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.300
We need to grab the X and Y for the second.

92
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.600
vector

93
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.400
so

94
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.200
The formula was as follows if I want

95
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.600
 to draw the second vector.

96
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.300
I'm going to go V.

97
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.100
W2

98
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.700
Okay.

99
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.400
the position of this Vector is relative to Vector 1

100
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.400
so for its X

101
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.800
Or it's X I'm going to call the vector function to draw a vector.

102
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800
And this will have to be a tuple.

103
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.000
So for we have X and Y, correct.

104
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.200
So it's going to be math.

105
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.900
What the sine? Of course? I think it was sine math DOT

106
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.800
 sign of C.

107
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.500
cosine similarity I wanted to

108
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.200
Same thing for why it's gonna copy this bit.

109
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.400
But this would be cosine.

110
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.100
Okay. Now I'm going to draw the second vector.

111
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.800
We'll make this red.

112
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.300
Okay.

113
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.200
Well, is this good or bad or is this close or

114
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.300
 not? So not close. There's only one way to know that's to create a third vector.

115
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.600
So I'm going to create a third vector.

116
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.400
This will be the course now the angle for these functions would

117
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.200
 be the cosine similarity of 1 and 3.

118
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.900
So we first compare one and two now we compare one and three.

119
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.000
And let me make the first Vector black.

120
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.100
That's the that's our.

121
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.100
point of reference

122
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.400
And then we will make the green one.

123
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.500
Let me let me draw this again.

124
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.100
Just so you can see the black vector.

125
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.500
So that's the original one.

126
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.300
and then

127
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.600
let's add the third vector.

128
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.100
third Factor

129
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.600
now one more time because I forgot to change reassign this

130
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.300
 value. So again, this is the first vector.

131
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.100
This was a dog right supposedly dog. This is

132
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.500
 cat.

133
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.600
And now let's do the building.

134
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400
And let's make the color.

135
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.400
green

136
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.300
Yeah.

137
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.100
So you can see.

138
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.100
dog and cat

139
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.900
or closer to each other to have a

140
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.900
smaller angle
