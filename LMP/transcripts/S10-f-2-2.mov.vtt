00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.300
so we have three types of

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.800
fundamental networks. We have the multi-layer perceptron

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.300
 multi-layer perceptrons are sufficient for

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.400
Tabular data, so if you have an Excel sheet with five six

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.900
 seven columns.

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.400
And you want to do regression or classification? You can create an

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.800
 MLP.

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.900
And it's very trivial to create an employee with libraries like pythorg

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.900
 and tensorflow.

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.700
if you're going to be dealing with

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.700
sick

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700
images especially images of

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400
three color channels and you will use a convolutional neural network

13
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 again the word convolution has to do with

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.800
This Matrix operation in a convolutional network.

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 We have two types of matrices The Matrix

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 representing the picture.

17
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.200
And the Matrix which is the kernel which is

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.800
 used to.

19
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.900
for lack of whatever words to

20
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.500
observe the super pixels of

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.900
 the picture

22
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.900
I think we've seen this before.

23
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.500
I think I've shown your kernel but not we will look at it. And then

24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 and one of the sessions where we will do

25
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.500
 you will use CNN for image recognition and then there's a recurrent neural

26
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.900
 network. Long story short.

27
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.500
You would use MLP. You have simple tabular data. Everything is

28
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.000
 numerical.

29
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.400
CNN's if you have

30
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.000
You know.

31
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
Square matrices anything that needs to be put in scrimmage like

32
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.400
 a picture or videos after all videos are sequence of

33
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.600
 pictures.

34
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300
And our events if you have sequential data.

35
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.600
for time series for

36
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.400
speech to text or text to speech for set table

37
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.800
 analysis.

38
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.800
by the way, if any of you are interested in

39
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200
predicting stock

40
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900
Is what predicting stock prices it's very problematic because

41
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.300
 something you really can't really can't do

42
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.400
 but beside if you're interested in.

43
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.800
You know buying and selling stocks.

44
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.000
Well the price of a stock.

45
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.600
Is strongly influenced by public opinion?

46
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.600
And so there are some companies that use sentiment

47
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.600
 analysis to see what people are saying about certain topic.

48
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.600
Like what was that stock game game

49
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.800
 stop?

50
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.600
Game Stop, right

51
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.500
and people

52
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.100
What was the what they were using when they were on

53
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.300
 Twitter?

54
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.800
opposite of Short Selling

55
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.600
opposite of shorting

56
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.000
longing right they were trying

57
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.200
 to Long the game start by showing people were talking about

58
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.900
 the old Nokia or all the you

59
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 know,

60
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.400
electronic

61
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.000
forms of entertainment and so they were making the making

62
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.000
 the price go up. So as people's basically you

63
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.500
 could you set them analysis to see you are people

64
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.400
 sentiment positive about this topic.

65
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.700
The price is going up. Let's buy it.

66
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.400
If the if people are saying negative things, let's say

67
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.400
 I don't know the CEO of this particular company said something

68
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.400
 very terrible. Well something very racist or

69
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.700
 sexist or whatever and the price is going to drop and so

70
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.400
 you can use sentiment last to detect that and then start

71
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.700
 shorting or start selling.

72
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.200
Exactly wrong.

73
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.000
So now of course.

74
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.100
Getting access to the data is another story.

75
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.400
Then a bunch of nurse

76
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.600
 that are going to stop exactly yeah as as to retaliate.

77
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.000
 It's very fascinating story. But yeah the point is this

78
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.600
without going to off topic here you if you have

79
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.200
 if you want to process sequential data like anything

80
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.600
 do with time.

81
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.100
Or words or sound bikes

82
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.200
 you won't use RNs, but of course,

83
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.200
 like I said, you can be can combine.

84
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.500
Like for one problem that I'm working on I'm using

85
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.100
 a drnn.

86
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.500
Which is a combination of convolutional networks and

87
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.200
 recurred recurring units because what I want to do is go from

88
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.900
 pictures.

89
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.300
to

90
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.100
a sequence of characters

91
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.200
Basically, I think I talked about this. I want

92
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.400
 to look at a mathematic a picture of an equation.

93
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.200
And converted to a later code

94
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.500
 which is a sequence of characters.

95
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.200
Yeah, and thank you one for sharing the the background

96
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.800
 of that GameStop scenario.

97
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.400
So yeah, we'll set them allows as you can see, you know, what people are talking about and then

98
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.100
 react.

99
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.500
or preemptively

100
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.600
Okay.

101
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.200
Now there is stuff. This slides have to

102
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.800
 do with the mathematical representation.

103
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.400
Here's an example of using a CNN for

104
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.800
 pictures.

105
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.300
So for example you take this picture of

106
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.700
 a cat this picture of the cat is colored. So

107
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.000
 you have at least three color channels red green and blue.

108
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.000
and each

109
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.200
channel will be put into its own Matrix, which we call

110
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.300
 a

111
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.200
two-dimensional convolutional

112
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.600
layer, it's called 2 of 0 because we have two dimensions

113
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.800
 for each color Channel.

114
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.400
And it's called the convolution because we're going to convolve.

115
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.000
the kernel

116
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.000
with

117
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.200
each

118
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.100
color Channel

119
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.500
now I will show you convolution in a

120
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.700
 separate session, but the idea is in this particular architecture

121
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.300
 you will go from

122
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.500
the picture to a flat Factor

123
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.700
 again a linear transformation

124
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.300
and this flat

125
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.300
vector

126
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.300
will correspond to the distribution

127
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.000
Again by the way, yes matrices

128
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.700
 are very important for new Networks.

129
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.800
But at the end of the day, this is still machine learning statistical

130
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.500
 learning. So distributions are very very important.
