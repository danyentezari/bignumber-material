00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.300
Okay.

1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.200
Now now that we know what we've done this quick review

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
 of such let's talk about

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.900
a vectors

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.800
so of the word space

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.000
really means set.

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.600
So why not just say Vector set instead of vector space?

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.800
because spaces imply some

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.900
 sort of

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.100
some rules apply

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.300
There are some ordering there are some operations you can apply to

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.400
 the elements on the set. So we try to be more specific.

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.300
and

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.900
we also want to be careful well.

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.100
There's another word here. I want

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.600
 to use element.

16
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.600
Okay, so they were element.

17
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.500
In the in the context of linear algebra.

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.600
we

19
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.300
the convention is not to use the word element in a

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.700
 set. The convention is to use the word.

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.300
Well the scalar.

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.100
the scalars of a set

23
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.400
so in linear algebra and element can be

24
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.500
 called scalar.

25
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.500
or point

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.400
or

27
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.600
component

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.200
and it's unlikely free to see elements. So you see these all

29
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.800
 the elements elements are all.

30
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.400
synonyms

31
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.200
for members of a

32
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.100
matrix

33
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.100
and of course a vector is a type of

34
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.700
 Matrix.

35
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.200
Okay, so these words are interchangeable.

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.300
Okay.

37
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.300
So we can call this point point.

38
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.500
or a component component

39
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.400
 component element element scalar scalar

40
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.600
 scalar

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.100
Interchangeable, unfortunately, that's how it is in

42
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.300
 mathematics. They use different words to refer to

43
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.800
 the same thing.

44
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.200
furthermore

45
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.400
We don't.

46
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.600
use curly brackets

47
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.900
or curly braces the convention is to use either parentheses.

48
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.700
or

49
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.600
square brackets

50
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.300
both are interchangeable.

51
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.600
Okay, let me pull up my notes.

52
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.300
Run asks, which version of python anything version

53
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.700
 through your above? Okay. Let me pull up

54
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.000
 the

55
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.300
my notes very quickly. Here we go in your algebra.

56
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.500
Okay.

57
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.500
So what is a vector space?

58
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.800
a vector space

59
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.400
actually, no, hold on. I I don't want to jump this is

60
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.800
 this is supposed to be vector.

61
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.000
So

62
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.400
vectors

63
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.000
are sets of

64
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.400
elements

65
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.500
however

66
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.100
vectors

67
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.500
are conventionally referred to

68
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.900
as spaces with scalars

69
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.400
Okay.

70
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.000
now

71
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.300
and of course

72
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.400
we use lowercase letters to indicate them.

73
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400
 So like so

74
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.900
and they will either come.

75
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.400
with an arrow on over them like so

76
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.100
Or like I said in our first session it could be

77
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.100
 they could be bold like so.

78
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.100
Okay.

79
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.900
so we call the numbers either scalars or components of

80
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.900
the vector

81
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.700
Okay.

82
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.800
we also want to talk about

83
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.100
a linear span linear combination

84
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.000
row space and column space

85
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.400
so we have a linear combination.

86
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.600
And then we can do an exercise.

87
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.400
combination

88
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.200
And we will do.

89
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.100
linear span

90
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.400
and the column space

91
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.800
and then the row space.

92
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.300
And before we do this, we'll also talk about matrices.

93
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.100
So we want to

94
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.700
be clear with our

95
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.200
terminology

96
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.700
Okay. Now let me come to Vector space.

97
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.100
 Let me actually borrow it from the chapter of this book because I

98
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.100
 thought I had written it here a vector space over the

99
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.600
 field.

100
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.200
K with the following axioms

101
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.100
Okay.

102
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.000
The X seems are a vector addition.

103
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.500
Factor multiplication, so let me pause pause

104
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.200
 over here and turn the abstract algebra in a

105
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.200
 moment.

106
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.400
Okay, here we have it says that a vector space fee

107
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.100
 over the field.

108
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.300
What does over mean and what this field mean?

109
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.800
So let's

110
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.500
pause here. I'm gonna open another document to

111
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.200
 talk about abstract algebra a little bit.

112
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.600
so this will be

113
00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.900
abstract

114
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.100
tutorial one

115
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.900
Okay.

116
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.100
so

117
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.600
I say this will take about 15 or so minutes.

118
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.200
But I mean if you if you do not have exposure to

119
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.000
 abstract algebra.

120
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.400
This would this is going to take you along. This

121
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.300
 will take you very far.

122
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.600
later on when you

123
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.000
I don't know.

124
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.400
Want to read more advanced probability or go into something

125
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.700
 called measure Theory?

126
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.800
Knowledge of abstract algebra will be super beneficials. So

127
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.700
 we'll begin with something called a

128
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.100
binary operation

129
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.600
Okay.

130
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.800
so this is

131
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.500
abstract

132
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.800
algebra tutorial

133
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.100
binary operation a binary operation

134
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.300
is some sort of arithmetic operation that it

135
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.300
 can apply to the elements of a set.

136
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.000
For example addition and multiplication are both

137
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.600
 examples of binary operations.

138
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.000
Okay, so let's establish this terminology

139
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.000
 binary operation.

140
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.700
and then we have

141
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.600
our first

142
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.400
special type of set an abstract algebra,

143
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.200
 which we call the group.

144
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.400
A group can be expressed.

145
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.000
as the Tuple and again Tuple is a set set curly,

146
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.100
 but it's

147
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.500
Okay, not cool three elements.

148
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.800
 We would say a triple or three three Tuple

149
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.000
 or four tubular five people. So however many elements you have

150
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.200
 in that set. You say number two pull.

151
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.100
Okay.

152
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.000
G is the set

153
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.600
and here the start indicates the bunny

154
00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.600
 operation so it can be multiplication or addition.

155
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:10.900
Well, we don't we

156
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.000
if there are some certain rules.

157
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.800
We don't use the word. It's quite big and these

158
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.000
 are the axioms that apply to the group.

159
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.300
 By the way. The group is the foundation. We will build

160
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.400
 on top of so other types of sets and abstract algebra

161
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.900
 are variations of groups.

162
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.900
We first have something called closure.

163
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.700
What does closure mean?

164
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.800
Clojure means that if you were to perform a binary operation on

165
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.100
 the elements of the set.

166
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.600
The outcome would be another element that also belongs

167
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.300
 to the set.

168
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.100
So let me actually change this to G.

169
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:53.700
Okay.

170
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.300
What's an example of?

171
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:56.600
such a

172
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.700
rule the integers

173
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.200
if we take two integers or let's keep it

174
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.600
 simple if you take the natural numbers.

175
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.500
Add them together you will get another natural number.

176
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.200
So 5 plus 5 gives you 10 which isn't which is still an

177
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.000
 element within the natural numbers.

178
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.100
Multiply them you will also get another element.

179
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.300
but that division doesn't apply because if you divide

180
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.600
for example

181
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.500
4 over 5 the result is not going to be division. So that

182
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.300
 operation does not apply to that set.

183
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.200
Okay.

184
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.800
So there's closure then there's identity.

185
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.400
And identity says that there exists a number.

186
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.000
Such that when you multiply it.

187
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.000
By any of the elements in that set you get the element again.

188
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.300
So here what could what number could that be if we were

189
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:52.800
 talking about the

190
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:55.800
the integers

191
00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.400
What number if we multiplied with any element would give

192
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.800
 us the same number? So for example, let's say a is 5.

193
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.700
A times what will give you five?

194
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.300
The number one. So here I stands for then and

195
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.500
 this is a unique element.

196
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.400
This is a unique element exactly. What?

197
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.300
So it the identity says that

198
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.100
 there exists a number such that multiply by an element

199
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.000
 of the set, you know, you get you get the same number and then there is

200
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.600
 inverse.

201
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:30.600
Okay.

202
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.000
We'll see an example of this but there's a number.

203
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.200
the

204
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.300
if you have a number and you multiply it by its inverse.

205
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.000
You will get the that unique identity identity element.

206
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.800
And then there's associativity.

207
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.400
Which says that well, for example, if you're doing

208
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.200
 multiplication multiplying eight B times

209
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.200
 C and then multiplying it by a it is we'll give you the same.

210
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.300
Result if had you done 8 times B

211
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.700
 then times C this associate associated.
