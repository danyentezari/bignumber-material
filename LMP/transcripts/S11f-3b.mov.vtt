00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.400
So we have 50,000 images for

1
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.800
 training 10.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.900
images for test

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.800
now let me

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.500
show you some of the pictures. I mean, we just saw it in the

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.800
on the website, but

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.400
we want to make it part of our notebook.

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.200
So here let me add some sections to

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.400
 this notebook.

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.500
This is

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.300
import

11
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.200
libraries

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.000
and data

13
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.800
Let's call this part 1.

14
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.400
and then this will be

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.900
part 2

16
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.100
review

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.900
the data

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.200
so we said that c410 has 10

19
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.800
 classes.

20
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.400
Sorry.

21
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.100
And what we want to do is plot.

22
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.400
a grid of

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.800
a grid of 10 pictures

24
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.100
and then when a loop over 25 samples

25
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.200
And then plot those so we will say.

26
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.100
or

27
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.600
I in range.

28
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200
The range function will create a sequence of numbers.

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.900
So here we want from 0 to 25.

30
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.900
And I will say PLT Dot subplots.

31
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.600
and

32
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.000
this is index.

33
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.400
We want we don't this is not a Cartesian

34
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.700
 or any kind of coordinate system. So we're going to empty out

35
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.900
 the

36
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.200
like remove any labels from the plot

37
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.600
So we'll pass your empty list.

38
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.100
save for the y-axis

39
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.100
We don't want any grid.

40
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.000
again, because this is not a

41
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.600
coordinate system

42
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.300
and then we want to impose the picture or superimpose the

43
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.400
 picture.

44
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.900
Well from each class.

45
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.900
So we have train.

46
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.600
images

47
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.500
and then we want to say yeah, I want to put the

48
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.300
class level of each picture and on the x-axis like

49
00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.800
 stable.

50
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.400
class names

51
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.700
train

52
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.800
labels

53
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.500
So if I show you the train labels?

54
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.900
up here

55
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.000
It's going to be a list within a list.

56
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.200
So if you want to preview a particular class.

57
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.100
we will need to go inside the list first and then

58
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.600
get the scalar value.

59
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.700
So that's what we have to

60
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.300
sets of square brackets

61
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.700
So what we once we run this code, this is why we should see.

62
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.400
No, this is not what we should see.

63
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.400
What did I leave out?

64
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.400
It's a plot singular.

65
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.600
and then I am

66
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.100
I am sure.

67
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.100
There we go.

68
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.100
So again the picture we just saw and but it's a good idea

69
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.300
 to have them here and our notebook.
