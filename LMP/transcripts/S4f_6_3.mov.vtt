00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.300
What we're gonna do now is we're going to play around with this

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.700
 identity Matrix and we want

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.200
 to use it. We want to use this identity Matrix.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.900
Not to get the same Matrix back.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.500
But to get a third Matrix where two

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.600
 rows have either been swapped

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200
 around or they've been

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.100
 manipulated somehow we have one two.

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.400
Negative 3 and then we have negative 3 negative

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.900
 4. Okay, what we want to do is get this Matrix.

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.400
gradually into upper triangular form

11
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.300
so to

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.000
To do that we need this negative 3 to become zero.

13
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.600
Then we want to get this 2 to 0 and I'll

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.900
 give this one to be equal to 0.

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.500
So these numbers?

16
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.600
We must get to be equal to 0.

17
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.500
Okay.

18
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.800
Using this identity Matrix or an adaptation of the identity Matrix.

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.800
Let me show you something. I'm going to copy this code.

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.600
And instead of having one one.

21
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.900
 I'm going to go.

22
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700
111 in the opposite direction, so I'm flipping the

23
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.300
 axis.

24
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.600
Let's see. What happens when I do that.

25
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.100
I'm going to call this I underscore.

26
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.100
What happens when I do that?

27
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.200
Can you see what has happened?

28
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.100
the third row

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.200
Which is 215.

30
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.200
Is now at the top.

31
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.700
And the first row which is one two negative 3.

32
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.000
Is now at the bottom.

33
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.400
My point is the way we would.

34
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.300
Where we put a 1.

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.300
Is going to allow us to what performable operations

36
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 let me see if I can give you a very simple example.

37
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
A very simple I will come back this original one. So I'm

38
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.300
 just going to create a very small Matrix. Let me call this.

39
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.500
M.

40
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400
Just the two by two.

41
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.600
and let's make this to

42
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.900
and zero

43
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.300
and we'll make this one and one.

44
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.300
Okay, I want to

45
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.300
solve this Matrix

46
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.800
using

47
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.500
a modified version of the identity Matrix

48
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.900
Okay.

49
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200
So we have one zero.

50
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.900
Zero one's across the diagonal obviously.

51
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.200
And like before if I were to multiply these matrices.

52
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.400
Not get back the same Matrix.

53
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.700
Okay, 2 0 1 1 2 0 1 1 now

54
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.100
 if I want to solve this Matrix, I would have

55
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.200
 to subtract 2.

56
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.100
from 1

57
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.000
so

58
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.500
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go I'm going

59
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.700
 to call this e e for elimination.

60
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.800
So this is the original Matrix right? Again, that's the identity Matrix.

61
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.000
one on the principal diagonals

62
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.700
if I set this to

63
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.300
negative 1

64
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.100
here's one way to read it.

65
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.600
Let me actually plug in more numbers in here just to expand just to

66
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.800
 make this bigger. So you have some.

67
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.600
A better idea. I will make these zero down here.

68
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.400
Again, if I set this to zero, you have an identity Matrix.

69
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.600
if I set this to negative 1

70
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.600
Basically, here's one way to interpret it.

71
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.800
We're saying add to the second row.

72
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.800
the difference of the first row

73
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.700
add to the second row.

74
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.600
the difference of the first row

75
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.700
So whatever two is.

76
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.800
So imagine this is R1.

77
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.200
This would be R2. This would be R3. This is how you

78
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.400
 you read the rows of an elimination Matrix.

79
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.400
Add to row two negative one of R1.

80
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.400
so basically multiply these by

81
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.700
 negative 1

82
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.100
and add it to the second Matrix the second row.

83
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.100
I just want to make this part clear. So let me just add this

84
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.700
 comment here.

85
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.600
So this is R1 R2 all

86
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.500
 of these are R1 R2.

87
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.300
2

88
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.000
or 2 and everything here's R3. So basically

89
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.900
 here's what I'm trying to say.

90
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.200
Okay.

91
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.200
Because elimination Matrix is a type

92
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200
 of encoding Matrix.

93
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.000
if you keep

94
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.100
What's across the diagonal to one so if I keep this

95
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.400
 one I'm saying.

96
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.000
Keep Row 1 what it is.

97
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.400
If I make this one and the other zero.

98
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.300
I'm sick. Do not change Row 2 keep

99
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.100
 R2 what it is.

100
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.500
And if I set these to zero.

101
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.400
And I make this one that I'm saying keep

102
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.700
 R3 what it is.

103
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.600
if however I

104
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.800
make this one I'm saying keep R3

105
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.200
 what it is.

106
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.800
But add R1 to it.

107
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.900
So it's like I'm activating rule one.

108
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.900
Row one will be added to

109
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.100
Row three

110
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.400
so for example

111
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.800
Let me make this zero again.

112
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.400
Okay. Once again, we will get the same Matrix.

113
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.500
But I try to get across this idea that we

114
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.600
 can play around with this identity Matrix to

115
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.200
 eliminate.

116
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.200
And get to the upper triangle.

117
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.800
So let's return to the above example.

118
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.200
And do this again? Okay. I'm going to go back

119
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.500
 to the identity Matrix.

120
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.100
Set these.

121
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.900
to 0

122
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.800
okay.

123
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.700
I'll do one example.

124
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.200
When I get to the second the third

125
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.100
 elimination matrices, you should get the idea. Okay.

126
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.300
So if I run this now, I'm going to get the I say Matrix.

127
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.000
So one two negative three, we want to negative 3.

128
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.000
Negative. Okay. I hope you can see they're all the

129
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.500
 same. Okay. Now I'm going to make this my first elimination Matrix.

130
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.600
To get to my first elimination Matrix. I need to get rid of minus three.

131
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.900
 I need this to become a zero.

132
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.600
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create my first elimination Matrix.

133
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.300
This will be a modification of the identity Matrix.

134
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.100
So to get rid of this.

135
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.300
Negative 3 I need to multiply Row

136
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.200
 1 by 3.

137
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.300
So this will become 3. This will become 6. This will become negative 9

138
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.400
 and then add this row.

139
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.400
to the second row

140
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.100
because three plus negative three they cancel each other and we get

141
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.500
 to zero.

142
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.100
So I'm going to go.

143
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.700
negative 3

144
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.100
Okay.

145
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.600
And then I'm going to multiply together.

146
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.300
So I'm going to multiply my first elimination Matrix.

147
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.400
times a

148
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.000
Okay.

149
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.000
It's supposed to be negative 3 or 3.

150
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.300
It's supposed to be 3.

151
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.100
So you see here?

152
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.200
Our first row is the same.

153
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.200
Our third row is the same but now we have

154
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.100
 discarded the leading negative 3

155
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.200
 in the second row.

156
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.400
That's my first elimination Matrix.

157
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.500
and my so I will now reassign a

158
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.400
to this evaluation

159
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.100
Okay, so my a has been updated.
