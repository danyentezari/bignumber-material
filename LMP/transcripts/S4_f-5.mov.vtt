00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.400
Let me show you the code to

1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.500
 do the same thing in numpy.

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.300
And then what's refer you with once we get

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.600
 the syntax of not Pi I'll switch over to

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.300
 talk about types of matrices.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.900
And then once but then we'll we're ready to talk about Led composition.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.800
So I'm going to open.

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.300
new notebook

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600
Matrix operations

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
IP y

10
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.900
in b

11
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.200
So now what I need to do is go back up here and do.

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.100
Gaussian elimination, but with no pie. So what I'm

13
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.800
 gonna first do is import numpy.

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.200
import

15
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.000
numpy

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.000
as NP

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.900
and then I'm going to use S to represent my

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.200
system

19
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.600
Cuba great question would be a scorpion are using it's called Jupiter.

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.400
So if you want to do jupyter notebook whether I

21
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.300
 recommend this versus installing Jupiter notebook separately

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300
 if you click on the extension the

23
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.000
Extension icon is for boxes.

24
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.000
Search for Jupiter.

25
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.700
do

26
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.200
better

27
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.100
and all you need to do is Click.

28
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.200
Install restart vs code and you're good to go.

29
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.400
Now the reason I have to wait a while for Notebook to

30
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.200
 open up is because I have different python versions. I

31
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.300
 shouldn't uninstall them. But otherwise for you should be straightforward.

32
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.400
I've attached instructions on the dashboard.

33
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
Or vs code so go to the instructions and you can have the same

34
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.500
 setup.

35
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.100
Okay, so I'm gonna have S stand

36
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.300
 for my system of in a

37
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.300
 qualities here. So we have

38
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.800
two rows

39
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.000
with

40
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.500
100

41
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.400
and 3,000 again. I'm gonna leave out the

42
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.100
10 to the power 4 part

43
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.100
and this is 200.

44
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.300
100

45
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.000
4000

46
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.400
Okay, so and of course, I'm going to turn this into a numpy array because

47
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.200
 I want to perform.

48
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.800
Matrix operations using numpy

49
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.200
Okay.

50
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.200
So let's begin.

51
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.500
Now the first thing I did was swap Row

52
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.600
 2 and Row 1. I'm just gonna do that up here. I'm just going to

53
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.000
swap them around like so

54
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.600
okay.

55
00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.900
now

56
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.700
if I want to

57
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.100
subtract row

58
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900
two from Row 1

59
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.500
I would do it this way. So we have

60
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.200
 row.

61
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.500
And of course we have to remember that we count from zero in in

62
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.600
 programming. So if I

63
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.800
 want to say the first row, I would have to put in 0

64
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.800
and if I want to say row two two minus one,

65
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.700
 that's one.

66
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.900
Okay, so if I want to subtract these two.

67
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.300
I'll come back to the difference method. But yeah, if

68
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.900
 you want to subtract the second rule.

69
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.200
From the first row so subtract the second

70
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.800
 of the first row.

71
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.800
We type in the first row minus second row and then it will

72
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.500
 subtract the second row from the first row.

73
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.100
 And then if I want to replace the first row, I'm going

74
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.000
 to go that's

75
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.700
sub z s of 0

76
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.200
Equals well that difference.

77
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.400
And to see the result I'm going to Simply print.

78
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.600
Yes, so let me run this again.

79
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.400
by print s

80
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.100
you can see we have done just that.

81
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.700
100 zero 1000 100

82
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.500
okay, and I can continue this way. So right

83
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.200
 now I need to subtract Row 1

84
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.400
 from Row 2 and then plug it into.

85
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.200
row to okay, so that's I mean this was

86
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.000
 this was supposed to be

87
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.000
our underscore to

88
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.300
our underscore

89
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.200
to

90
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.000
just make me careful here.

91
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.400
Okay.

92
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.400
So this I'm just going to copy this bit.

93
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.300
So I'm going to subtract Row 1 from Row

94
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.400
 2.

95
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.600
now addition, of course in Python it has

96
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.100
three

97
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.500
applications you can use it to add two.

98
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.300
Numeric data types, so intent float, you can

99
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.200
 use it to concatenate two strings together you can use

100
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.400
 it to merge to list together.

101
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.000
But I'm just trying to make this look as I'm trying to

102
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.500
 make the python code look as much.

103
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.400
You know to make it as close to what we

104
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.100
 see in there and in the market file and the math.

105
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.100
So here I want to subtract.

106
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.100
the second row from the first row

107
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.100
and then replace the second row.

108
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400
And there we have it.

109
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.600
And then you get the idea right then we would multiply the

110
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.400
 first row by whatever 100 and until

111
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.600
 we get to this point.

112
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.200
Until we get X and Y.

113
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.100
Okay.

114
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.600
So I won't finish this this part you

115
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.700
 can you can do this on your but I hope you get the idea now.

116
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.500
So what I'm going to do from this point I always is

117
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.500
show you

118
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.200
what?

119
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.500
inverse Matrix identity matrices do

120
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.900
to any any Square Matrix

121
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.800
and then we can see it's output.

122
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.100
every stop of the way
