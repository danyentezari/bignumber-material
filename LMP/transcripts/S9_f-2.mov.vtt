Let's say we have this Matrix.

1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.500
to decompose this Matrix is to create

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.600
 three matrices that look like so

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200
what are these matrices?

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.100
you

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.600
Is an M by m?

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.400
Diagonal matrix orthogonal Matrix now I

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.500
 will need to clarify what orthogonalism

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.900
 Worth or normal is. This is

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.900
 a matrix containing is a diagonal matrix.

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.700
containing singular values

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.200
the singular values of

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.500
a

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.300
matrix which is not denoted here.

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.300
We will see that in a minute. And then the V

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500
 Matrix or V transpose is also an orthogonal

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.900
 Matrix or I should say V here.

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.000
V transpose is all orthogonal Matrix and

18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.800
 a itself.

19
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.100
Is an M by a is an M by n Matrix, so

20
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 it doesn't have to be square in this example is a square

21
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.800
 Matrix, but you can perform SVD on Rick on

22
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.700
 any rectangular Matrix.

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.400
So I would be the number of rows and would be the number of columns.

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.200
We want to see how we can decompose this

25
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.700
 now to decompose this if we have a free perform

26
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.900
 SVD on this Matrix.

27
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.100
We would get.

28
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.100
u s v

29
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.100
Which will be equal to?

30
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.300
the following

31
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.400
Then we have the Matrix S which will contain

32
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.400
 the singular values or eigenvalues?

33
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.600
So this is 10 times.

34
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.300
The square root of 2 what is 10 times square

35
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.200
 the square root of 2?

36
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100
10 times the square root of

37
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.500
2 so that's 2 to the power.

38
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.600
0.5 14

39
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.200
okay, I'm just going to

40
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.200
on the up to the two decimal places

41
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.300
then we have zero and then zero.

42
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.500
And then five times the power square root

43
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.300
 of two so five times.

44
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600
the square root of 2

45
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.900
So 7 7.077 point?

46
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.600
07

47
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.800
that's the Matrix S. So these are the singular values.

48
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.000
Okay.

49
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.600
Now we'll talk about why this particular Matrix is so

50
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.800
 important.

51
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.400
And then we have V transpose, which is

52
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.000
 in this case.

53
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.200
One over the square root of 2.

54
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.500
so 1 over

55
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.000
to the power

56
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.900
0.70

57
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.500
for all of that

58
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.900
So let me break down the steps for you.

59
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.400
How we can go from this?

60
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.500
To that. There's quite

61
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.200
 a bit of work involved here.

62
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.100
Well, then once we understand the steps, we can

63
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.400
 apply these steps to any.

64
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.900
Matrix

65
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.600
and then we could

66
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.700
Do image compression we could extract?

67
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.500
You know, if you remember we talked about PC that

68
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.700
 the principal components.

69
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.500
for Dimension and I reduction so

70
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.500
all of the application of SVD would be

71
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.100
available to us
