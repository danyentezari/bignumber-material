00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.600
So they get the characteristic polynomial.

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.200
this Matrix

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.400
Okay, I just put the times just so you know that we are multiplying them

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.700
 together. I'm just going to go and remove them again.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.600
So we're going to take this product.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.900
subtract it from a

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.300
a minus this Matrix

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.100
a minus that Matrix

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.500
the difference we will put inside the determinate function.

9
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.900
which will

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.300
output the characteristic polynomial which will

11
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.100
 will look like you will see what it will look like now so we have

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.300
And this will be basically be well.

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.100
if you remember about the what we said about determinant, it will be the

14
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.400
the product

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.700
of the numbers on the main diagonal subtracted by the product

16
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.600
 of the numbers across the other time, but

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.400
 we must first take the difference of these two matrices. So

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.600
 I'm going to take

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.000
Matrix a

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.800
and if we subtract from The Matrix a

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.200
This product Matrix this new Matrix Lambda. I

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.100
This will become 2 minus Lambda and

23
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.400
 3 minus Lambda. So the determinant of

24
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.700
 that.

25
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.000
this

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.600
expression

27
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.200
times

28
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.600
that expression minus this

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.500
component times that component and we

30
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.100
 will get the following polynomial.

31
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.900
That is your characteristic polynomial.

32
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.800
step 3
