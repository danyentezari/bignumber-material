00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.300
In order for us to plot vectors like this.

1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.200
After having calculated their cosine similarity. We need

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.400
 to talk about the polar coordinate system.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.100
So let's first talk about.

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.000
The first prerequisite okay.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.300
This is going to be about cosine.

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.200
similarities or similarity

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.100
And the polar coordinate system.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.900
and this will be a foundation for

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.900
Other topics that we'll be covering this course, but later on even for differential equations

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.700
 why differential equations, but because the prerequisite

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.300
 for differential equations in particular partial differential

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.900
 equations is complex analysis.

13
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.900
And you know in complex analysis we have these imaginary numbers.

14
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.300
And so we use the polar coordinate system extensively.

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.400
Okay.

16
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.300
anyway

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.200
Let's create a new section here called cosine.

18
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.600
alrighty

19
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.000
And the formula is this.

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000
or side similarity

21
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.200
you would get the angle Theta and that's how you'll know how far these words

22
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.900
 are apart from each other.

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.300
Let me show you how to do first calculate this with python and then how

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.900
 to plot it.

25
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.700
So I'll return to vectors IP ymb.

26
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800
And let me talk about the magnitude by the way.

27
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.900
So that's this term here in the denominator.

28
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
to calculate the magnitude is the square all the

29
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.900
components of the vector

30
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.500
add them all up and then take the square root of the sum.

31
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 So we get something that looks like this we will

32
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.300
 first add up all the components of the vector. So let's say

33
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.300
 the vector has components ABC and we'll

34
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.500
 have

35
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.500
A squared again. We have an arrow over the a okay.

36
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.400
 So these two are distinct are over Amy's Vector.

37
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.500
 This is component of that Vector a squared plus b squared

38
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.200
 plus c squared. F for example, this is

39
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.600
 over R3.

40
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.700
And then we take the square root of this sum.

41
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.100
We're taking the magnitude for

42
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.000
both vectors

43
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.500
So how do we calculus and python?

44
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.200
Here, let me close this.

45
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.900
what I'm doing here is

46
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.200
enumerating

47
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.300
Or all the components in the vector v. So Visa vector

48
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.500
and we

49
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.400
denote X

50
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.900
Let me put x sub. I just to make it especially clear.

51
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.400
extra buys a component in v in the vector v

52
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.400
I'm going to import the math Library.

53
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.600
I will take every X

54
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.300
 of Y of v and it raise it to the power too. So

55
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.100
 this is the power method.

56
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.300
X is the base 2 is the power just like we saw earlier.

57
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.200
This will give us a list.

58
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.300
X sub 1 squared x sub 2 squared x sub 3 squared

59
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.100
 and then we will use the sum function that's built into python to add

60
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.700
 up all the elements in this set.

61
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.100
Once we have the sum.

62
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200
Take the square root.

63
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.600
And that's of course how you calculate the magnitude?

64
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.900
To calculate cosine similarity of two vectors we do this.

65
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.200
Okay, this function will take two arguments two vectors.

66
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800
First we have the numerator.

67
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.800
So we multiply these two vectors together.

68
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.900
and then the denominator

69
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.300
which is the product of

70
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.800
their magnitude

71
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.300
and then the return value of course is diffraction.

72
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.200
I'm going to go cosine similarity of

73
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.600
 word Vector 1.

74
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.700
and would Vector 2

75
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.400
I run this.

76
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.000
It has a midst undefined we found this again.

77
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.200
that

78
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400
we get well, it's almost one.

79
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.200
Let's look at the cosine similarity of Ward 1 and Ward 3.

80
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.100
I can see it's it's

81
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.600
it's smaller number.

82
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.500
So they are not relevant. What about word to

83
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.900
 one word three?

84
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.700
Yeah, still not as high as these two.

85
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.700
Now these are angles.

86
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.200
How do you plot these angles on?

87
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.600
a plot like

88
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.400
like that one. So, how can we visualize this?
