I'll put this link in this is of course some GitHub

1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.400
 you can access it.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.100
You don't need anything, but I'll share this with you.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.400
 Just go through the cells one by one.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.300
So you can see this is the this is what the sigmoid function

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.700
 does, right it plots it on this on

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.000
 this s looking.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
I mean, this is this this is this you're seeing

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.400
 them. This is the model plotting. It's not

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.200
 the actual observations is the model of the observations.

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.300
And if you if you draw a line.

11
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.300
you will get this red line, but what the

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.500
the expert function does

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.900
is

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.700
like you're seeing here it will.

15
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.400
push it up to one if it's

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.100
if it's a true if it's a truth classification and bring it all the

17
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.800
 way down to 0% false classification.

18
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.400
That's really what I try. I mean, I'm trying to speed up

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.200
 the explanation.

20
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.000
Okay.
