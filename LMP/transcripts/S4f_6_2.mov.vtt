What is an elimination Matrix? So now we have to talk about types of

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.000
 matrices? Let's first talk about the identity Matrix.

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.200
Then let's let me show you how to get to to a lower

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.600
 triangle Matrix and then you will understand what we mean by elimination matrices.

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
Let's say we have this Square Matrix.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.400
We want to factorize this Matrix. We want

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.900
 to extract from this Matrix.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
the L Matrix and the U Matrix

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.600
to get to the you Matrix. We must first do the

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.300
 L Matrix.

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.600
To get to the old Matrix. We need a sequence of

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.000
 elimination matrices.

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.300
Here's the idea.

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.400
In the previous example where we use Gauss elimination.

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.400
Yes, we did those raw operations, but we did not keep

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.700
 track.

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.600
of which

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.000
numbers we use

18
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.000
or what order we used.

19
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.400
Well, I guess we could say we keptract because here I

20
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.500
 have.

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.300
Replaced R2, but that's not what I mean. When I

22
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.200
 say keeping track of the operations. I mean having a

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.900
 matrix.

24
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.500
Or a collection of matrices that says you did

25
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.100
 this to Row 1 and then you do this to row two and then you

26
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.800
 do this to row three and these are written in matrices. Now what

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.400
 I actually mean let me show you so I'm gonna keep this here

28
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.100
 and I'm gonna open LED composition that IP ynb

29
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.100
Okay, once again, I will import.

30
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.400
Numpy as and P.

31
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.800
And then I'm gonna recreate this Matrix.

32
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.400
The first thing we are going to do is

33
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.300
what we want to do is again, we want to get to Upper triangular form,

34
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.000
 right so we want

35
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.100
this to be 0

36
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.500
and then these two to be 0

37
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
okay this to be 0 is to be zero

38
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.100
 this to be 0 and everything across the diagonal should be

39
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.900
 a non-zero value.

40
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.600
How would we get rid of?

41
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.800
Negative 3 that's the first thing we need to make zero.

42
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800
Well, let's see one way to get rid of three.

43
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.100
Is to First multiply this row by three.

44
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.000
So this would come 3.

45
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.200
This would become six that will become negative 9 but we

46
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.500
 don't care about these two what's important to us? Is that if we

47
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.600
 multiply this row by three, then we

48
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.800
 could add these two together.

49
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.600
3 plus negative 3 would cancel out row two.

50
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200
And as far as we're concerned that's considered elimination.

51
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.000
Now I can use the same code I did another file.

52
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.600
As zero plus S2, but that's Gauss

53
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.400
 and elimination. We don't want to do calcium lamination. Okay, let

54
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.100
 me show you what I mean.

55
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.500
Now this I will denote as a

56
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.900
And then I'm going to create a matrix called I called NP

57
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.400
 dot array. This is going to be the identity Matrix

58
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.500
 that I've been talking about.

59
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.000
What's in the identity Matrix?

60
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.300
You have a square Matrix. That is the

61
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.300
 same size as the Matrix to what you want to

62
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.300
 multiply this identity Matrix and we have

63
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.800
 these values. Basically I an identity Matrix

64
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.400
 is a matrix with

65
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.700
 zeros everywhere except across the diagonal

66
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.500
 the main diagonal. Why is it called identity Matrix?

67
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.100
 Let me show you I will show you the result of this evaluation and

68
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.100
 then I'll show you a picture. I'm going to

69
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.200
 go NP.

70
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.500
dot mat more

71
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.500
this is short for matrix multiplication.

72
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.600
So I'm going to apply the identity Matrix to the

73
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.100
 original Matrix.

74
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.400
When I multiply this you can see we get

75
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400
 the same Matrix again.

76
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.300
I mean, it's the same thing. How was it possible? So I'm

77
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.700
 going to pull up a picture of Matrix.

78
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.300
Multiplication this is a good example the way

79
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.500
 you will multiply two matrices.

80
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.400
Is with multiply well the first number.

81
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.600
In the first row times the first

82
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.400
 number in the First Column of the second row. If you

83
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.500
 look at the picture you should get the idea and then there's some

84
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.100
 of these two products. So two times three zero times four that

85
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.500
 would become the first value in the resulting

86
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.900
 Matrix.

87
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.600
the by arranging the numbers and identity Matrix

88
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.600
Like what we just saw we will get back the same resulting Matrix.

89
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.400
You can take a second or two to look at this. So one times a

90
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.700
And then zero times C. And

91
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.300
 then zero times e holy see

92
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.500
 these zeros right these zeros.

93
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.300
are going to cancel out the other terms and

94
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.800
 all you left is one times a

95
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.000
and what times e is just a

96
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.000
look at this so that you're convinced that.

97
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.400
The identity Matrix will give you the the original Matrix.
