00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.800
so today

1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.200
we are going to look at systems of

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.600
 equations.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.200
Yeah, we will.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.600
look at

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.600
systems of equations in the context of a linear programming

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.000
 problem

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.700
applied to economics

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.600
So I'm going to give you an example problem in economics. And

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.400
 by the way, I'll give you the reference for the book. This is

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 this is the cover it's from Dover.

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.600
Dover Publications, it has several example. Well more

12
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.800
 than several examples are of linear programming

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.900
 in economics and biology.

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.300
And finance. So the one I'm going to give you is

15
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.500
 an adaptation of one of the problems economics.

16
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.000
and turns out to be actually relevant to

17
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.600
What's going on?

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.400
at this point

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
you know considering

20
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.500
What's going on out there in the world? This is something that

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.300
you know alludes to that.

22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.100
so

23
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.000
we're going to do two things. We're going I'm going to

24
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.700
 give you a an example.

25
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
of a linear programming problem

26
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.800
or LP for short

27
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.000
and specific to economics

28
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.000
Okay.

29
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.200
Now you don't you don't need to have domain expertise. This is just

30
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.500
a

31
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.600
I mean the focus here is the on the mathematics of LP.

32
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.400
So if you understand this.

33
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.300
Problem and the way we approach it. You can apply to other

34
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.400
 problems. Yeah. Yes. Goyal. I'll

35
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 the I'll I'll post when I when I

36
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.100
 start with a markdown, I'll add the link to the excuse me

37
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.400
 the

38
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.000
The author the name of the publisher of this book.

39
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.800
So we will do that and then of course.

40
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.300
To plot because we have to plot.

41
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.000
the constraints and the optimization function

42
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.200
We are going to use.

43
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.100
Python for that so we're going to use matplotlib.

44
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.100
or

45
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.100
graphing

46
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.300
the lp problem

47
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.900
No LP problem number one.

48
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.400
number three

49
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.500
And if time allows it, we're going to talk about ludcomposition.

50
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.400
the composition

51
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.000
Which is the technique?

52
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.200
for solving multiple solving a system

53
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.800
 of equations

54
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.000
without

55
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.100
manually performing

56
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.900
row operations and a lot and the

57
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.900
numpy library has

58
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.900
a method for solving

59
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.100
or

60
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.400
performing LED composition of a matrix. So remember the way

61
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.200
 we go from system of equations to a solution is to

62
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.900
 take the constants.

63
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.400
Or the American values of an equation or the equations put them

64
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.000
 in a matrix. If you don't remember I'll remind you about it.

65
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.000
And then perform some raw operations

66
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.200
 alternatively what we will well I

67
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.800
 hope it would have time to do is talk about this technique called LED composition.

68
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.700
 It's an algorithm.

69
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.300
it's a mathematical algorithm which we can also Implement both

70
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.600
 python, but numpy has the method anyway, and this

71
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.700
 method allows us to

72
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.800
well solved to get this lower this

73
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.700
 lower upper triangle.

74
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.100
If you remember we said the solution of

75
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.400
a

76
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.000
Matrix let me grab a tab here.

77
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.500
from the browser

78
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.200
if you remember we said that if you you know that you're looking

79
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.500
 at a solution for a system of equations if you get

80
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.200
Something that looks like this.

81
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.000
I know I meant to do this one reduced row.

82
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.100
Echelon form

83
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.800
so here

84
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600
if your Matrix

85
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.000
Goes from looking like this, right? These are

86
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.900
 the constants.

87
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.800
Of these variables and of course, these are the values on the

88
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.300
 right side of the equation.

89
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.800
You know that you've solved the system of equations if you

90
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.500
 get this.

91
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.000
Matrix

92
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.100
okay. So LED composition is one way we

93
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.600
 can get to solution for a system of equations.

94
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.600
Okay.

95
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.900
Value the composition. I'll go rhythm.

96
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.300
Good.

97
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.100
This is well. This is a programming implementation. There's also a pseudocode.

98
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.100
This is the pseudo code.

99
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.200
I'll show you clear one, but you get the idea. So

100
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.400
 it's an algorithm for solving systems of equations.

101
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.300
and

102
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.200
the problem that we're going to look at has only two

103
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.800
 constraints.

104
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.500
Again, if you don't remember what that is you I'll remind you. I'll introduce you

105
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.100
 to the idea moment. But in the real world, you'll have more many

106
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.800
 more than just to constraints. Okay, and

107
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800
 by the way the assignment which

108
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.100
I will post on Saturday will be

109
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.400
 a linear programming problem. So you will exercise your abilities on

110
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.000
 numpy matplotlib.

111
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.000
and linear algebra

112
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.400
Of course so number four.

113
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.000
Lu decomposition

114
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.300
with python

115
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.000
and numpy

116
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.400
algorithm

117
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.100
and then we Implement a python.

118
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.500
Okay, so let's begin with the example that I'm

119
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.000
 maybe we want to look at this economic problem.

120
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.100
so this is going to be

121
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.100
LP

122
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.500
example this one and Danny

123
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.400
 can ask question. Yes, please. Go ahead.

124
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.700
so

125
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.300
In this LP problem. It looks

126
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.700
 like you have a square Matrix. So it's all the

127
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.700
You know you got more.

128
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.400
Or you got equal number of equations as the

129
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.300
 number of variables now in the case that you don't have it and

130
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.600
 you only have like a solution space.

131
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.000
Will you be showing how we might?

132
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.800
look at

133
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.400
the objective function

134
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.300
to form a tangent to the

135
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.200
space that could give the solution

136
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.800
To does that make sense?

137
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.000
You refer to a square Matrix. We do not have

138
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.900
 a square make which which example are you looking at by the way? Let

139
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.800
 me go to dashboard.

140
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.700
And the system of the equations The

141
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.900
 Matrix that you showed just now.

142
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.800
Oh you need a picture?

143
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.400
Yeah.

144
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.100
so X was two and Y was

145
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.900
it was

146
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.000
It was this one.

147
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.100
Right you referring to this? Yeah.

148
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.800
Yeah, so you got three equations and three are known so it's solvable, right?

149
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.100
 Mm-hmm. But if you

150
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.100
 had two equations and three unknowns

151
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.100
Then you cannot solve it what you're gonna

152
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.700
 get is a solution space.

153
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.200
Okay, so yeah. Well, yeah, I mean now

154
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.600
so let me show you one more thing. Let me show you an alternative

155
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.400
 form.

156
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.600
So this is in that situation you have to draw a tangent.

157
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.300
 You have to draw the the objective function has to

158
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.200
 be a tangent.

159
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.300
Or the the max hit the maximum point of the

160
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.500
 solution space. So how do we do that using?

161
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.100
Python numpy. It's basically my question.

162
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.400
Do you have an example problem?

163
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.100
I will yeah, maybe I will send it to

164
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:26.700
 you. Yeah, yeah.

165
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.500
separately

166
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.700
Yeah that yeah you if you have a picture of it from some

167
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.100
 web page you can put in the chat and you know,

168
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.900
 I can address it.

169
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.100
All right. Okay. So let me give you

170
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.900
 let me give you what's going what we will do and the background so

171
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.200
 this is LP problem.

172
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.700
Now picks example number one.

173
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.900
I'm gonna zoom out.

174
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.300
So it doesn't take up much more space again. You want to look here

175
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.200
 on the right panel? Okay.

176
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.400
So here's the background.

177
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.800
We have a imaginary country.

178
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400
that exports

179
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.700
Grains, like wheat and barley we call

180
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.700
 countries like this that export.

181
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.400
Soy coffee beans and like essential food items to

182
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.800
 other countries of bread basket.

183
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.500
Okay.

184
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.500
So when it comes to wheat, it's you know, Russia, Ukraine.

185
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.700
other countries in Eastern Europe many countries depend

186
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.000
on the Imports of these countries, so

187
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.300
you may have heard the news right now that the price

188
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:38.600
 of

189
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.300
Bread has gone up and this

190
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.700
 is problematic in many countries where bread?

191
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.600
is the main

192
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.200
Food of consumption the price goes up and

193
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.800
 that just drives the price of many things up. It's

194
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.400
 coincidence. Now, this is the problem because it's the one I found

195
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.700
 in the book, but I adapt it.

196
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.100
To make it, you know relevant to

197
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.300
 well, you know what we're hearing then used today. Anyway, we have this country that

198
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.700
 exports great to other countries.

199
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.400
And they need to ship.

200
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:11.700
their their

201
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.800
their green so there is a there's a state-owned manufacturer

202
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.800
 a government owned company that produces containers

203
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.000
 we call these container liners. They look

204
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:22.600
 something like this.

205
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.500
container

206
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.700
liner

207
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.900
so, you know you put these in the cargo like

208
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.100
 they want to find in mirisk, but these are you know

209
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:36.900
 meant to keep

210
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.800
the grain dry

211
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.000
It's just for cargo, okay?

212
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.700
now they have

213
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.200
two types

214
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.500
two designs two models

215
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.000
one is the standard model.

216
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.100
And the other one is the premium. So what's

217
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.400
How are they different?

218
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.100
Okay, and of course, we we denote the standard container

219
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.300
 would C sub s and the premium one

220
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.800
 would see sub pieces the C stands for container.

221
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.400
So the standard container can contain 100 kilograms of

222
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.700
 barley and 100 kilograms of wheat.

223
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.400
Or as a premium one can hold 200 kilograms of barley and

224
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.600
 100 kilograms of wheat.

225
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.500
I'm not an expert in agriculture, but

226
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.200
Apparel you can design containers this way. You

227
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.900
 can mix it together.

228
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.900
Now this company the

229
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.200
 state owned manufacturer now, it doesn't matter if

230
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.300
 it's date on a private. It's just

231
00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.200
then the numbers here are the and the variables are

232
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.500
 important for us this company. This manufacturer has

233
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.600
 received a quote.

234
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.200
to sell or provide

235
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.000
the government with containers

236
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.500
for the following

237
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.000
the manufacturer is supposed to

238
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.200
 produce continuous for 30 million tons of

239
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.300
 Wheat and 40 million tons of

240
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.200
 body. Now I've used

241
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.700
This notation because when it comes to plotting it

242
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.000
 will become easier. So we're going to actually drop the units of measurement.

243
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.400
So we will stick to 34,000 not just

244
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.700
 for context it. They export

245
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.300
 in the millions in the millions of tons.

246
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:26.900
now

247
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.200
what we want what what this LP problem is

248
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.000
 about is maximizing the profit margin for

249
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.600
 the company.

250
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.600
What combination of containers can we use to maximize

251
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.200
 the profit?

252
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.000
So they will earn 80 cents of the dollar.

253
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.500
if they sell

254
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.700
premium containers and 70 cents for

255
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.000
the standard container

256
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.100
Okay.

257
00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.300
and

258
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.300
all we need to do first.

259
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.100
Is Express the objective function?

260
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.400
So basically we need to model the relationship between

261
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.200
 how of how much they will make.

262
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:15.800
and

263
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.600
then maximize this function.

264
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.300
So this is the objective function.

265
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.400
Okay.

266
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.700
Let me copy this bit here.

267
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.600
There's a lot of information going on in here, right? So

268
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.400
 let's break it down. I'll break it down. Okay, just

269
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400
 give you some background first.

270
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.900
You put some light break in here so we can scroll up.

271
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:45.400
All right.

272
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.300
Okay.

273
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.100
So let me actually put these up here.

274
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.100
Because I don't want it. These are not the same. There's a different

275
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.200
 task. So this is the problem.

276
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.600
tasks

277
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.300
and then there's the lp tasks.

278
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.500
So the objective function is the following the objective function

279
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.000
 is this

280
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.300
They will earn 80 cents.

281
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.800
For every premium container that they that

282
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.600
 they sell to the government.

283
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.200
And 70 cents where we stand a

284
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:46.300
 container.

285
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.800
That they sell.

286
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.700
So the objective function is a function of two variables.

287
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.600
the number of Premium containers and the number of data containers

288
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.000
Not good for convenience.

289
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.500
We're going to swap.

290
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.500
C sub p and C Sub C with X and

291
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.100
 Y. It's just notational convenience. So

292
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.000
 we will let x equal to the premium the number

293
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.700
 of Premium containers and Y equals

294
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.800
 to the number of

295
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.600
standard containers

296
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.000
So this is the objective function now.

297
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.900
It is a function of two variables.

298
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200
And this is the relationship.

299
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.500
Now we want to maximize this.

300
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.100
But we have constraints.

301
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.500
We have this constraints.

302
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.600
What are the constraints let's see.

303
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.500
The constraints are the following.

304
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.600
the first one

305
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.900
now these constraints say that then

306
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.600
 the combination of containers

307
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.700
 you use the number of continues use cannot exceed.

308
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.300
The amount that you're allocated.

309
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.100
So for example in the for wheat, we have

310
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.200
 30 million tons.

311
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.900
So we need to I mean, yeah, so

312
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.000
 we cannot exceed.

313
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.100
Whenever we when we solve for this equation,

314
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.800
 we plotted we cannot exceed the quantity.

315
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.100
And of course the below one is for the body.

316
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.400
These constraints will once we plotted and

317
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.900
 you know solve for the roots the X and y's.

318
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.300
We will know up to what number of standard or

319
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.000
 to what up to what number of Premium containers we can you know,

320
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.000
 we can we can adjust.

321
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.900
So the tasks are this.

322
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.500
Given the objective function. So let's now this

323
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.800
 is our new objective function the one that's f of x

324
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.700
this is the objective function.

325
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400
And these are the constraints.

326
00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.500
tasks number one

327
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.400
We need to find the feasible region.

328
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.700
for the objective function

329
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.200
And then find the best point.

330
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.300
within that region

331
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.200
so we need to know what are the limitations of our parameters and then

332
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.600
 within the within the

333
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.000
within the region

334
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.100
of our parameters. What is the most what is the

335
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.100
 point? I'll give us maximum profit.

336
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.600
Okay, this is only two constraints.

337
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.400
But then we can generalize it for problems, but

338
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.300
 we have multiple constraints.

339
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.800
So for tasks number one.

340
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.800
for task number one

341
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.700
We kind of did this in session one?

342
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.300
We must find the roots.

343
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.400
Of the constraint of the constraint functions or the

344
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.300
 constraint equations.

345
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.700
To find a point outline diffusible region. So

346
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.400
 we have two constraints and both by the way in LP problems

347
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.400
 the objective function and their constraints are

348
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.000
 all linear meaning they produce lines.

349
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.400
So we're not going to look at quadratic equations

350
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.400
 every variable in the

351
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.100
 lp all variables in the end. The lp problem

352
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.700
 will have will be raised to the power one.

353
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.600
Not more than that.

354
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.100
Okay.

355
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:28.500
so

356
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.500
the first constraint is going to produce one line

357
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.200
 the other conceptual produce another line and

358
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.800
 then we need to

359
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.200
well find the region that does not.

360
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.300
Overlap into the other region you will see exactly what

361
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.700
 this means once we start plotting.

362
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:48.900
All right.

363
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.000
Now what we need to do is of course.

364
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.500
to solve this

365
00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.200
you must explain the constraints which are currently inequalities.

366
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.800
And express them as equations.

367
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.900
So we have the following two equations.

368
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.400
So you can see.

369
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.800
and remember 200x

370
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.400
X is the number of

371
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.700
the premium containers

372
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.600
why is the variable corresponding to the standard containers?

373
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.700
so this is constraint one this constraint to

374
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.400
in order to find the reason we have to solve for x and

375
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:34.500
 y

376
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.000
so first

377
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.300
now, of course we could put these two equations into a matrix

378
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.000
 and then do

379
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.300
Galveston elimination

380
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.000
But this is only two equations so we can

381
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.400
 just do something simple. So we have equation 1 and equation

382
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.800
 two subtract them subtract first equation from the up the

383
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.500
 one below and then we can simplify some more. So

384
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.600
 200 minus 100 gives us 100x.

385
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.700
100y my minus 100 y that

386
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.500
 just gives us 0 y

387
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.200
now, of course this wouldn't appear in the equation, but I'm just putting it here. So, you

388
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.300
 know that this is now eliminated.

389
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.600
And of course 4,000 minus 3,000 is 1000.

390
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.300
So again, we're getting we're getting closer to finding

391
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.600
 the most points of the feasible region. Yes question. Oh,

392
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.300
 so how can we drop 10 dish to the power for

393
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.400
 I mean at both the places here in both

394
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:32.900
 the equations.

395
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.300
Can you repeat the question?

396
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.600
So in the constraints there is a quantity 10 raise

397
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.200
 to the power 4. So how did you drop this quantity

398
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.400
 in both equations?

399
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.000
How do I draw?

400
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.400
Yeah, even how do I graph them?

401
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.300
So probably you have dropped them because the

402
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.900
 constraint says it hundred X plus hundred Y is

403
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.200
 less than or equals to 3000 multiplied by 10

404
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.500
 raise to the power 4 varies in this equation two

405
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.500
 you have you you wrote this this this this thing in

406
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.300
 the right hand side is 3,000 only so

407
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.300
 oh, yeah, it's quantity. Yeah.

408
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.700
 No, I just did it because it just for convenience. But so

409
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.900
 but this is still 10 to the power 4 and this

410
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.100
 is still 10 to the power 4.

411
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.900
Yes, because 4,000 minus 3,000 probably

412
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.400
 won't be same as yes, it

413
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.500
 would be same. Yeah. Yeah in that way. Yeah, right, okay.

414
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.300
I only did this and I know this is not precise, you

415
00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:37.000
 know, we should keep the units of measurement we should keep but but

416
00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.200
 I did that intentionally just to

417
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.200
because tuning out to me too many numbers.

418
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.300
 I thought we simply but anyway, we'll keep this.

419
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.500
It's a good thing you brought it up.

420
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:47.500
right

421
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.100
and then

422
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.200
We simplify. So right now we have

423
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.200
 to find what x is equal to and what Y is equal

424
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:57.200
 to.

425
00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:58.500
by

426
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.900
performing some classical algebra Elementary

427
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.000
 algebra. So first we find X.

428
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.100
So y goes out of the picture.

429
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.300
And we divide 100.

430
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.600
We divide both sides of the equation by a 100 so I can let me just simplify.

431
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.000
 It makes up think so that I clear here.

432
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.200
This zero would go away.

433
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.800
And then we would have to get 100 to go on the other side.

434
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.100
and then this of course if you want to keep

435
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.100
our scientific notation

436
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.200
okay, and then

437
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.400
I'm just gonna leave this out for now. Okay, because

438
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.300
 I'm gonna I'm gonna confuse myself as well.

439
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.400
 But here we know where we this implies that this

440
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.400
 is actually 100 times 10 to

441
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:57.800
 the power 4.

442
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.100
Okay, I'll leave a note here note.

443
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.300
here

444
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.300
10,000 is actually

445
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.700
times 10

446
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.500
power 4

447
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.400
here we can I close to going to type in a Million.

448
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.500
tons

449
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.300
in the interns

450
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.700
Anyway X is equal to 10.

451
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.100
Quick comment here when we say 10. We shouldn't forget

452
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.500
 that. This is 10 times.

453
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.700
10 to the power of 4

454
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.200
so X is actually equal to

455
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200
100,000

456
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.400
So we found our first root. Now, what we

457
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.100
 do is now that we know what x is we plug it in we plug in

458
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.400
 X for the other equation.

459
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:55.800
So then we get

460
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:57.900
this bit

461
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.800
so we call this.

462
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.800
solving for x

463
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.800
and then

464
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.300
solving four y

465
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.900
solving

466
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.200
or

467
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.000
why?

468
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.300
So what we have done here.

469
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.900
Is we've taken equation number.

470
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.600
That's 100 y so they say this equation 2.

471
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.800
equation 2

472
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.200
equation 2

473
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.300
so here

474
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:01.800
we have

475
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.300
3,000 again here with this implies

476
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:06.600
 that it's

477
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.400
you know.

478
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.400
30 million

479
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:12.700
and

480
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.400
let me just make sure I didn't leave anything out by mistake.

481
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.700
I think I did.

482
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.900
Yeah, I was supposed to bring this here.

483
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.700
So we take equation two.

484
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.800
We take the 10 this 10 over here.

485
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.200
Right. That's our root for X the value for the root X.

486
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.400
And then we plug it in into equation two. So this

487
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.800
 becomes 100 times 10.

488
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.600
Plus 100 y equals 3,000 or

489
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.800
 actually 30 million.

490
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.500
And that's exactly what we've done here.

491
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.700
Okay again, just to be consistent with the notation. I

492
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:09.200
 am going to

493
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.800
There we go. Like so

494
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.200
again, I don't want you to be too fixated on the

495
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.900
units of measurement or the scale the proportions

496
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.800
I just want you to see that the idea here is we have two inequalities

497
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.200
 to express them as equation and then we solve for x and y

498
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.400
 to find a point that is the key thing here.

499
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.500
So we do some algebraic manipulation right

500
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.500
 here. We have 100 y. So in

501
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.600
 order to move this term to the

502
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.400
 right side, we substrate we subtract it. So 100 times

503
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.300
 10. That's a thousand.

504
00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.800
So now we get 3,000 from up here.

505
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.100
Minus 1,000 so it is this move

506
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.200
 to the right side of the equation.

507
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.400
Subtracting these two we get 2,000. All

508
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.700
 right, it's actually supposed to be you know, 20 million.

509
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.500
And then we divide.

510
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.200
we divide 200 over 100 because

511
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.800
you know, this is what we're getting the 100 from right? It's this one.

512
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.500
this 100

513
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.700
we bring it we divide both sides by 100 and

514
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:19.300
 it gives us 20.

515
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.600
So in other words the root for X is

516
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:23.700
 10.

517
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.000
And for why it's 20 which gives us this point.

518
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.500
Now what I want to show you.

519
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:35.200
is

520
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.700
plotting part 1. So again, we have we have done part 1

521
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.100
 so far or should this task one, which is finding the

522
00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.700
 feasible region of the objective function.

523
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.500
So I'm going to switch to python out to show you how it's done with python how

524
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.200
 we will use mathplotlib to plot this.

525
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.200
And then we'll return to find the best point for the objective function.

526
00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.500
And that is the point.

527
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.300
In the feasible region that will maximize the profit.

528
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.800
So to do this, I'm going to open a notebook.

529
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.700
Let me open it up again LP example that pi.

530
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.900
The cells should appear.

531
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.400
Why is it not appearing?

532
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.200
No, it's not working. So I'm just going to use Co-op for this.

533
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.500
So I'm gonna keep this here.

534
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.200
And open call app.

535
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.600
Right next to it.

536
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:54.800
like so

537
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.600
new notebook

538
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.600
LP example

539
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:17.600
one

540
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:22.000
I would say this is a it would be a good idea for you to

541
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.800
 follow along by the way to actually type along.

542
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.400
example one

543
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.300
Okay. So first we're not going to use numpy just

544
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.100
 yet. We're going to use matplotlip.

545
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.600
Import if you're using colab this

546
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.300
 library is already pre-installed.

547
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:44.600
So I'm going to go Matt.

548
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.500
plot lip

549
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.600
Dot pipelot

550
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.000
as

551
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.600
PLT

552
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.100
quick question how many of you are familiar with this

553
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:56.500
 Library?

554
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.300
And I've used it if you know it and used it before typing y.

555
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.100
Otherwise type it in the chat.

556
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.900
Okay, fine. Okay. See some questions here. No one

557
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.100
 asks.

558
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.300
Do you don't you want to minimize the objective function don't

559
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.600
 you want to minimize the cost?

560
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.200
No, you're right in this example. We want to maximize the

561
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:23.400
 profit.

562
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.000
Okay.

563
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.700
If we sell these containers we will

564
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.000
 earn.

565
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.000
A sense on the dollar so that that's what we

566
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:33.900
 that's what we want to know.

567
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.900
There's the cost associated with manufacturing them and then there is

568
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.300
 the revenue we get from selling them and how

569
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:41.800
 much you will profit.

570
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.300
Okay, of course we can turn that we can turn this problem

571
00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.600
 around then trying to minimize the objective

572
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.100
 function if it had to with the cost associated with it, but this

573
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.000
 is about maximizing profit.

574
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.300
Okay. Okay. Everybody knows math problem. I

575
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.700
 don't need to say much about that. But let me go ahead and you know

576
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:03.600
 plot this problem.

577
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.400
So the first thing I'm going to do is generate a

578
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:09.900
 list.

579
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.400
of numbers

580
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:12.800
there is

581
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.300
A method within actually, I made a mistake. We

582
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.600
 do need to buy import.

583
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.400
but it's it's just

584
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.600
to produce

585
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.000
 some to produce some numbers.

586
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.100
Let me import no pi.

587
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.400
So X is going to be equal to NP Dot and

588
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.000
 we're going to produce a linear space.

589
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.300
A line a set of linear set of values.

590
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.600
from 0

591
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:45.900
that's the starting number.

592
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.300
Two, let's make it 100 and we

593
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.000
 want two thousand.

594
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.400
Numbers in this range. So this is a set of real numbers.

595
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.000
0.1 0.2.

596
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:57.900
all the way to 1,000

597
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.800
because the way we can produce a line.

598
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.700
on Matlab is to have

599
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.200
a sequence of points a sequence of

600
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.300
 XY points. So we need to trace.

601
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.200
Along the X and Y axis.

602
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.400
so we have X

603
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200
goes from 0 to 100.

604
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.500
And I'm going to express.

605
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.700
the constraints

606
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.700
as functions of Y

607
00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.900
So let me give you the code.

608
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.200
So here we are plotting.

609
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.600
the constraints

610
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.100
as equations obviously not equalities.

611
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.900
How do we get this? How do we get this function? Well if I

612
00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.600
 come down

613
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.100
here

614
00:32:59.300 --> 00:32:59.900
It's this one.

615
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:04.900
What we've done?

616
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.200
Is we have moved 200?

617
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:13.300
To the right side of the equation so we get 4,000. Obviously.

618
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.100
 I'm not including the million. I I don't want a graph

619
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.100
 that is that large I will label in

620
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.200
 the graph. I will label in the X and Y axis but I'm dropping the

621
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.200
 times the scientific notation from here,

622
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.000
 but it is 100 y equals 4000

623
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.300
 minus 200 x

624
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.200
so four thousand minus 200 times x

625
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.700
and to get rid of The 100.

626
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.700
I'm going to divide both sides of the equation.

627
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.200
So if we divide both sides of the equation, let me actually make

628
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.400
 this slide. Why?

629
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.500
sub 1 and y sub 2

630
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.600
Okay, make it less this confusing.

631
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.100
So to get rid of the 100s.

632
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.400
I'm going to divide both sides of the equation by 100 divide

633
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.700
 this side of the equation with 100 you get y1,

634
00:33:58.700 --> 00:33:59.900
 you get and divide.

635
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.500
This sort of the equation.

636
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.200
You could Y2.

637
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.800
Okay, so I'm really expressing these constraints as

638
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.600
 functions of Y.

639
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.600
I'm doing the same thing here.

640
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.100
I'm moving 100 to the right side of the equation. So we get

641
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.400
 3,000 minus 100. So 3,000 minus 100

642
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.900
 and of course to get rid of the 100. I'm going to divide for

643
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.500
 solid equation. Okay.

644
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.300
and then

645
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.300
I need to set the limits of my

646
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:32.800
 plot.

647
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.700
Math thought about automatically set the

648
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.100
 limits of on the X and Y axis, but I want

649
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.500
 to maybe leave some room.

650
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.700
for visualization

651
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.600
then I'm going to plot.

652
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:50.900
both of these

653
00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:54.700
equations. I'm going to plug both of these.

654
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.800
constraints

655
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.000
this is going to be y sub 1 this will be y sub 2.

656
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:05.400
Okay.

657
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:07.700
Going to run this.

658
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.900
So just to make it especially clear. This is the first

659
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.600
constraint

660
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.900
so our solution area is limited to

661
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.500
You know this triangular region.

662
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.900
but then when we involve the second

663
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:33.900
constraint

664
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.300
now well now we're confined to this

665
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:41.400
 region.

666
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.100
And you can see we have an intersection in here.

667
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.800
We would have we have just found this we found this by.

668
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.700
Finding the roots in our constraints and

669
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.500
 we find we found out that the point.

670
00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.900
On the feasible region is 10 and 20.

671
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.500
So we can take this and we can plot to indicate it.

672
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.300
So whatever our objective function is going to be maximized to it must.

673
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.400
Not leave this area.

674
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.100
Okay.

675
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.000
So let me show you what I mean.

676
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.300
and

677
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.300
Let me read label this one. So for

678
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.400
the first constraint

679
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.100
we have X must be greater than or equal to 0 so X.

680
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.500
Must be greater than or equal to.

681
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:34.900
0

682
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.700
and then y must be greater than or equal to.

683
00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:40.400
0

684
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:46.600
so plot

685
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.000
the

686
00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.800
constraints

687
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:02.000
This is as equations. And this is this was supposed to be expressed.

688
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.900
Express they cut straights.

689
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.600
as functions

690
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.200
of why

691
00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.000
all right.

692
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.200
Now the point the point that indicates the

693
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.300
 feasible region.

694
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.900
We use the plot method.

695
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.200
The point on the x-axis the point on the

696
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:30.600
 y-axis.

697
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.100
And then here we can choose the marker and the size of

698
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.500
 the marker and give it a color.

699
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.500
so plot

700
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:39.600
the point

701
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.200
indicating

702
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.600
a feasible

703
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.000
region

704
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.900
There we go. So our objective function.

705
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:54.400
must

706
00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:58.900
go through this point.

707
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.200
Okay, so we're getting closer to the solution.

708
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:06.900
and then

709
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.400
let me show you how I can fill in the region.

710
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.500
I can fill in the regions.

711
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.000
So I'm going to there's a method called.

712
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:16.600
the

713
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.900
field between method

714
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.300
so we have y sub 1

715
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:24.900
y sub 2

716
00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.100
and then we want to plot the region.

717
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.600
that where

718
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.200
the points in our first

719
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.700
 constraint or less than the second constraint again.

720
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.000
 This is what this is what it looks like.

721
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.600
and it did not work because

722
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.500
because

723
00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.200
Yeah, because we have okay, this was something else. This

724
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.700
 was supposed to be the masking area.

725
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.600
So before we mask.

726
00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:08.600
Then you actually plot the gray areas. So this will be through between

727
00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.700
so shade

728
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:14.900
the regions

729
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.600
under the constraints

730
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.600
So first, we'll do the first constraints. That's

731
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.400
 why so 1

732
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.700
which will give us that.

733
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.900
And then I'll pay for the second constraint. So why it's

734
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.000
 up to?

735
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.000
Okay, and this other plot, let me

736
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.400
 disable this for the second for a second.

737
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.800
We want to get rid of these regions.

738
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.400
So we should only see Gray.

739
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.900
In the feasible region, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to mask.

740
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.500
These areas.

741
00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.500
So I'm going to use the fill between method again, but I'm gonna

742
00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.900
 set the color to white and the alpha to one.

743
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.800
I will do this for both of the

744
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.000
both of these regions this region and that region.

745
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.800
And you will get this.

746
00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.700
This was supposed to be white.

747
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.100
one more time

748
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.700
y sub 1

749
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.100
y sub 2

750
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.000
1 sub 2

751
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:42.800
there we go.

752
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.100
So this is the feasible region now.

753
00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:50.800
Okay.

754
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.200
so this is it, this is

755
00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:00.800
A task one. This is the visualization visualization

756
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.300
 for task number one. So let me show you task number

757
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:03.500
 two.

758
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:07.300
Now that we found that V7 we want to find out the optimal point.

759
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.600
in this solution area

760
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.700
So I'm going to now do task number two.

761
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.300
Get a return here.

762
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.100
and

763
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.300
bring the preview so you can see what I'm typing.

764
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.700
And now we'll do task number two.

765
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.300
task number two

766
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:42.300
to find

767
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.200
the best point

768
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.800
is to say the point that maximizes the

769
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.100
 objective function so best.

770
00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.700
as a context

771
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.200
if we talk about minimizing objective function and the best is the

772
00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.500
 point at which the objective function is minimized.

773
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.400
And obviously if we talk about maximization at Port that

774
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.800
 the best point is the point at which the objective function is maximized.

775
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.700
So here we talked about maximizing.

776
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.300
So here if you remember this is the objective function.

777
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.900
It is a function of two variables.

778
00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.100
Or X is the standard container Y is the

779
00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.000
 premium container.

780
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.200
And then what we need to do is find these roots X and

781
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:32.300
 Y.

782
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.300
If we find these roots, we will then know the slope of intercept of

783
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.200
 this objective function.

784
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.600
And then we will know the line that cuts through.

785
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:42.900
that point

786
00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.600
so I'm just going to copy the algebraic solution.

787
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.600
Just to save us time.

788
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.200
Again, this is just the steps for algebra.

789
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.300
Okay.

790
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.800
Is it just steps for the algebra?

791
00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.500
Here I'm you know, losing this

792
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.900
 parentheses again just for notation convenience.

793
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.900
And then I want to solve for y.

794
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.600
So I can you know the whole divide we want to bring 70y to

795
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.200
 the left side. So that's why we get Negative.

796
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.300
And then we want to bring F to the other side. So that's why we have minus f

797
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.300
Again, that's the objective function.

798
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.600
And then we saw, you know, we divide both sides by 70.

799
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.000
And then we get this.

800
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.200
So here if you remember.

801
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.400
This is a specific case of y equals m.

802
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.200
X

803
00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.500
Plus p

804
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.100
the slope and The Intercept so MX controls the

805
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.700
 steepness.

806
00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.100
Of the curve and be controls the

807
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.300
 vertical the vertical

808
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.000
 positioning of the line.

809
00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.400
So here what are our what is what is M here

810
00:43:59.400 --> 00:43:59.700
 m

811
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.500
Here is equal to well eight of negative

812
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.000
 eight over seven.

813
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.200
Which is equal to what in decimal form?

814
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:18.800
one point

815
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.900
one for let's make it Round Up to 143.

816
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400
one point

817
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.200
one four three

818
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.800
and then the end y intercept.

819
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:32.100
is equal to

820
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.400
1 over 70 1 over 70

821
00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:43.900
times f

822
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:46.500
Okay.

823
00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.800
Now let me return to.

824
00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:54.800
collab

825
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.000
so here f

826
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.700
f is equal to

827
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.800
80 times 10 and 70 times 20

828
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.100
because

829
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.200
if I scroll up

830
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.200
to f

831
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:46.800
up here

832
00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.200
We already know what x is and we already know what Y is.

833
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.600
So what we're doing is we're plugging in X and Y.

834
00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.000
from the roots of the constraints

835
00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:56.800
Okay.

836
00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.100
So we get this.

837
00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.300
We get this if we evaluate this.

838
00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.200
At the roots we will know.

839
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:06.400
the

840
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.700
we will know the profit.

841
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.100
When the objective function is maximized.

842
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.500
and then I'm going to take

843
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.200
this snippet

844
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.600
to plot

845
00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.100
the objective function at its

846
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.300
maximized

847
00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.300
You know added in at the maximum at the point

848
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.300
 at which it is maximized.

849
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.300
So this will become.

850
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:51.500
and

851
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:02.400
and here

852
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.000
We'll come back to this in a second. Let me just paste that this

853
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.400
let me use instead of FF.

854
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.000
Oh for objective function.

855
00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.200
So this is the objective function.

856
00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.100
expressed

857
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.900
as function

858
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:40.900
Y.

859
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.400
again this

860
00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:55.700
this bit

861
00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.100
is equal to

862
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:01.900
This equation down here.

863
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.100
So we have solved F. So let me actually add let me add the

864
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.200
 the Math teachers. We have some context.

865
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.300
You scroll down.

866
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.600
So up here. We have f

867
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.500
and if we plug in

868
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:19.800
again

869
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.300
values for X and Y

870
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.400
and F

871
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:29.700
You would get.

872
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.100
f equals to 80 times 10

873
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:37.200
plus

874
00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.200
70 times

875
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.200
the 20

876
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.500
which would give us.

877
00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.200
T times

878
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.700
10 is just 800.

879
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.200
and then 70

880
00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.300
times 20

881
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.400
is 1400.

882
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:03.900
so all together that gives us

883
00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.100
2200

884
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.500
so what are we doing is we multiplying this term?

885
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.600
by 2200

886
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.200
so this effectively becomes

887
00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.400
well, you know, I'm just gonna you what's up

888
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.500
 with 2200.

889
00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.700
And that's what I'm doing here the python.

890
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:27.600
code

891
00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.500
close this again.

892
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:43.800
Okay.

893
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.400
So this is the objective function.

894
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.600
after plugging in for

895
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:56.100
x and y and finding

896
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.400
no plugging.

897
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.800
In values or X

898
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.100
 and Y.

899
00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.600
And I want to be plot this.

900
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.500
We get this red line.

901
00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.700
So this is the objective function.

902
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.700
at its highest

903
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.300
So the answer to this problem is this.

904
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:22.600
you need

905
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.200
10

906
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:26.700
containers

907
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.200
For so, what was it again? If

908
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.100
 you go up here we said that X is equal to

909
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.000
the premium containers

910
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.400
and why is equal to the standard containers?

911
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.000
And this is how we visualize it.

912
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:50.200
now

913
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.500
Before I you know, we turn our attention to LED

914
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:57.100
 composition and I answer any questions you may have about

915
00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.200
 this particular problem.

916
00:50:59.200 --> 00:50:59.900
this

917
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:02.100
example

918
00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.200
you will use to solve the assignment that

919
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:06.700
 will be due.

920
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.400
for next week

921
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.500
So the idea is the same you if you have first of

922
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.100
 all, every single linear program will have

923
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:16.900
 at least two constraints.

924
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.500
But the one for the assignment will have multiple constraints by the ideas the

925
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.800
 same you find the roots of the constraints.

926
00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.800
You find the roots of the objective function.

927
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.400
And then you plug in the values and then you highlight the

928
00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.000
 feasible region.

929
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.600
And when you do you would have known the point at which the objective

930
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.100
 function is maximized in this case. We know the point

931
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:38.900
 at which this.

932
00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.200
Company can make the most profit for the quotation

933
00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:43.900
 that they have received.

934
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.100
Does anyone have any questions?

935
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.400
About what we talked about so far.

936
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:58.200
Any comments?

937
00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:07.100
In the meantime, let me pull up an example of LED composition.

938
00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.500
 So

939
00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.200
if this is not if you if you

940
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.100
look at the feasible region and

941
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.400
so if x was 0 and Y

942
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.700
 was 30, right?

943
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.100
FX was 0 and Y was 30 correct? Yeah.

944
00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.000
yeah, so

945
00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:31.700
when we get a higher profit moment.

946
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.900
Wouldn't the value be?

947
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.600
if you plug x y equals 30

948
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.700
into this function here, the objective function

949
00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:44.000
 X would be zero.

950
00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.200
Well the first you be

951
00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:48.500
greater than

952
00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.200
Yeah, but 20 you're outside

953
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.700
 of the feasibility region. Okay. So here you see here, correct?

954
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.500
X equals to 30 to and Y is x equals

955
00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.300
 to 0 and Y equals to 30.

956
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:06.600
Yeah, so we said that X is equal to the

957
00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.600
The premium ones and S is

958
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.500
 equal to the standard ones.

959
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.400
Right. Let me see if I left it in here information out

960
00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.400
 here because if you are selling would need make sense to sell more premium

961
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:26.900
 ones.

962
00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.400
Do you see the y axis is not the y-axis is

963
00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.500
 not the y axis is not the

964
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:35.800
The Profit access

965
00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:38.100
So, let me see if I can make this clear.

966
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.800
I need I need to plot. All right. Yeah, I

967
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.900
 need to label these so.

968
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.300
It's not that X is the number of items you've sold and why is

969
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.200
 how much you've made?

970
00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.200
and the actual

971
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.200
profit if you want to know how much it is you would have

972
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:54.700
 to print.

973
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.200
You would have to print.

974
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.100
You would print this we would go.

975
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.100
This is the one.

976
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:12.800
the maximum profit

977
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.800
or this LP

978
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.100
is and I'm just gonna drop this in.

979
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.300
Now the scale is the scale.

980
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.700
the proportions

981
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.100
So this is actually sent 2200 cents.

982
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:50.600
See my argument is this.

983
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:55.200
If if you look at 80 X plus

984
00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.600
 70 Y and we use the optimal solution of

985
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.900
 x equals 10 and Y equals 20, then

986
00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.600
 you get 2,200 right 80

987
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.500
 times 10 plus 70 times 20.

988
00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.300
but if you made

989
00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:14.600
Y equals 0 and x equals 30 then

990
00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.100
 you get 2,400.

991
00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.400
which is a higher profit than

992
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.600
so here here if we set X to

993
00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:22.700
 0.

994
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:27.700
And then we said y to 30 we get 2,100 right?

995
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.000
 And then now you just said if what if we set

996
00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:31.600
 well actually equals to 30.

997
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.500
And then y equals 2 y 0.

998
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:36.800
y equals to zero

999
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:38.500
Okay.

1000
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.300
But you have to consider that then you'd be outside of your

1001
00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.600
 constraint constraints.

1002
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.600
Yes, so our constraints is what?

1003
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.500
However, you said this equation. You cannot exceed.

1004
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.700
 So which one is this?

1005
00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.800
the 3,000

1006
00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:01.700
well, we are not.

1007
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:11.100
Ex. Okay. So again this point you cannot choose

1008
00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.200
 a given the again you're supposed

1009
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.500
 to choose it the very the values of the variables

1010
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.400
 of the objective function such that it falls into

1011
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.400
 this region. So if you pick a point outside

1012
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.200
 of the feasible region sure.

1013
00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.700
But you cannot accommodate that.

1014
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.700
You cannot produce the car. You

1015
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.000
 don't have enough containers or you do not have

1016
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.100
 enough grains for what you can supply containers

1017
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.300
 so I can say hey I will if I

1018
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.100
 I will make the most profit if I sell.

1019
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.100
5,000 containers but no one's buying those containers.

1020
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.300
That's what the constraint is saying anything. No,

1021
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.200
 this is the this is the most if this is

1022
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.800
 how much for example customer you have or this is how much?

1023
00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.200
Items you have to store.

1024
00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.200
And you want to sell enough or so the

1025
00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:07.400
 the correct combination so that you you can Encompass

1026
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.700
 you can contain all of the Green in

1027
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.100
 this case and then sell them.

1028
00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:16.500
So if you pick something out here if you if you just sell a

1029
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:17.600
 premium containers.

1030
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.200
Well, then you're violating the constraints.

1031
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.300
Does that make sense?

1032
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:28.800
Yeah.

1033
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.400
I mean 30 is still within the constraint with the

1034
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.200
 feasible region. How is it wouldn't

1035
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.900
 visible region the feasible region is the gray area.

1036
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.300
Right. So x equal 30 Falls within that doesn't it?

1037
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.400
 No. No, it's just this is x30.

1038
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:49.000
 This is it. It's here. Sorry y equals that

1039
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:49.400
 white.

1040
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.400
I got it wrong. Okay, so why yeah. So again, if

1041
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.900
 okay if we said y equals to 30, I just did that see.

1042
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:58.800
Here I set sorry.

1043
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:00.900
Let me one second.

1044
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:05.100
So then it's the other way around 30 times 0 exactly

1045
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:07.000
 plus. So remember this is the

1046
00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.900
 what this is. Yeah. This is why and this is why it's less

1047
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.300
 exactly.

1048
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.000
Sorry, yeah.

1049
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.900
So you can pick any point across on this red line.

1050
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.100
And then you can of course plug in the valley see how much you're getting. So this is

1051
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.700
 the Mac. This is the point at which it's maximized.

1052
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.500
You can play around with us now. We can go. How about if we make it 11 and make

1053
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:28.600
 this.

1054
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.000
Make this 19.

1055
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:38.300
And is this within the feasible is this within

1056
00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.800
 the feasibility region? Well, let's see.

1057
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:41.900
for y

1058
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.500
it is but for x

1059
00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.300
I think if we added that for 11:19, we'll see

1060
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.600
 it's not in the gray region.

1061
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.400
See that again, please. If you added that

1062
00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.200
 like you did for 10 comma 20 out of

1063
00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.000
 that for 11 19.

1064
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.200
Oh, okay. You mean okay. So if we do

1065
00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:04.700
that's a good point.

1066
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.400
So if we do 11 and 19, let's make a different color. Let's

1067
00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:08.800
 make it blue.

1068
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.400
11 and 19

1069
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.300
Yes, you're correct. It is outside the future. It is outside the region.

1070
00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:27.300
Yeah, see this is okay.

1071
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:32.600
So I don't get into one of the country Institute probably violate the

1072
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.300
 constraint. Yeah. Yeah you correct. I don't know why I

1073
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:35.600
 was

1074
00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:42.500
Yeah, I got my coordinates from but yes, you're correct.

1075
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:45.400
 So, yeah, exactly. So if you put blue it is it gives a

1076
00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:48.400
 higher it gives us higher profit, but it is outside the feasibility

1077
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:48.800
 region.

1078
00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.100
So that doesn't count.

1079
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.200
but my point was the point I was trying to make with

1080
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.300
 this right now was that

1081
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.700
What were we saying? We were talking about. Yes this point being outside

1082
01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.700
 the feasibility region. So let me you lose.

1083
01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:10.800
lose that

1084
01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:12.500
all right.

1085
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.600
Run the spirit again.

1086
01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.200
run all

1087
01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.300
and bring back vs code.

1088
01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:26.200
Okay.

1089
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.100
We have 15 minutes. So let me not spend too

1090
01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.200
 much time on this I think.

1091
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.600
I highlighted the key points.

1092
01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.600
So the the primary tasks

1093
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.300
 you have to perform for

1094
01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.500
 for LP problem.

1095
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.200
And like I said, there will be an assignment which we will be very

1096
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:48.900
 similar to this one.

1097
01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.100
now let's turn our attention to

1098
01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.600
LED composition by the way

1099
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.800
Since I I you know, I was cut off. I

1100
01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.400
 just want to make sure if any if anybody says any

1101
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400
 questions any other questions

1102
01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.600
about this before I while I switch for.

1103
01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.600
the example with lu

1104
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.100
ella says no, okay.

1105
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.100
All right.

1106
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.900
So let me show you this.

1107
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.200
It's from Wikipedia.

1108
01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.100
I'm gonna show you this page from Wikipedia because I don't have

1109
01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.500
 it written in advance, but

1110
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:42.400
you'll get the idea.

1111
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.000
Okay, great. Now my keyboard.

1112
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.500
My track put it my trackpad

1113
01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:57.800
 is stuck.

1114
01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.600
l u decomposition

1115
01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.100
Wikipedia

1116
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.800
So remember

1117
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.000
 that we said if you have a system of equation.

1118
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.300
equations

1119
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.300
you need to get your

1120
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.000
Matrix into this form

1121
01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.700
What we have these zeros.

1122
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.600
Or we have trailing zeros at the bottom and once

1123
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.900
 on the diagonal.

1124
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:41.800
So well, this is why it's called Leu we have the lower.

1125
01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.700
And then the upper.

1126
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.200
so lower upper

1127
01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.200
that's what they recoveration does a decompose The

1128
01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.500
 Matrix into the lower number.

1129
01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.100
Now we can use this technique.

1130
01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.300
You know to solve specific equation. So this is the effect

1131
01:02:59.300 --> 01:02:59.700
 that we want.

1132
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.600
What if you remember we said that we want the ones across the

1133
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.500
 principal diagonal?

1134
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.900
this diagonal business by the way is very important, which is why in modules

1135
01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.700
 2 and 3 we're going to spend

1136
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.700
or we're going to spend two weeks on Square matrices

1137
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.800
 and in particular this idea of the principle diagonal so

1138
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.000
 we will talk about determinants characteristic polynomial

1139
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.000
 the DU decompet LED composition.

1140
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.800
so then once once we will learn different types of matrices and

1141
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.200
 in particular Square Matrix

1142
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.100
and the application of the square matrices we can

1143
01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.200
 then finally get into principal components and if you remember from

1144
01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.100
the slides

1145
01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.800
you will PC has very broad applications.

1146
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.100
Whether it's pattern mining in or pattern finding a machine

1147
01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:47.400
 learning.

1148
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.500
to being able to invest

1149
01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.500
Excuse me, predict the price of stock. I don't know. I don't like that word many

1150
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.200
 people says many people say experts and finance. You cannot

1151
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.100
 predict the price of stocks, but if you were to attempt

1152
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.400
to predict the price of stocks LED composition

1153
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:05.600
 would be

1154
01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.400
one of the most effective ways to do that.

1155
01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.700
to dimensionality reduction

1156
01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.100
 reducing the dimensions of your data, which is a

1157
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.200
You know a very important part of machine learning.

1158
01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:26.500
Because in module 4 we are going to focus on New Orleans

1159
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.300
 Works PCA is going

1160
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:32.100
 to be so I hope you know that a machine learning. We have a few stages.

1161
01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.500
There is the model part the machine learning part and then there's a feature engineering part.

1162
01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.300
 So in modules two, and three we will learn the linear algebra.

1163
01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:43.600
That allow us to PC and then later on understand Matrix operations

1164
01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.300
 for new electrical government module

1165
01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.800
 4. Okay. Let me show you the algorithm first

1166
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.800
 of the LED composition.

1167
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.200
Not the code version.

1168
01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:02.400
the pseudocode version so l u decomposition

1169
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.000
pseudocode

1170
01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.400
because I want to show you more mathematical form of

1171
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.800
 more mathematically formal way of expressing

1172
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.700
 the idea because you know

1173
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.900
Well, let's do it. No, this is not good enough. Let

1174
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.000
 me let me show it to you.

1175
01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.400
You know, sometimes we get lucky with Google Images, sometimes we

1176
01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:38.600
 don't.

1177
01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.700
Okay just passes but if I type it so if

1178
01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.800
 I pick a page the page of this chapter.

1179
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.700
Really you decomposition would be page.

1180
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:00.900
87

1181
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:06.100
Again, I know I promise to give you

1182
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.000
 the books and I will the reading material.

1183
01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.000
So This Is How We Do It

1184
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:14.800
All right.

1185
01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.900
Let me write down the algorithm first. So the algorithm is

1186
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.900
 as follows.

1187
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:24.400
we have

1188
01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:30.600
a for Loop

1189
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.500
So we enumerate.

1190
01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800
We go from y.

1191
01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.100
as excuse me, I

1192
01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.900
so we go from one two all the way to when

1193
01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.700
And then we have an inner loop.

1194
01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.700
So we have J equals.

1195
01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.600
I Plus

1196
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.200
one I plus 2.

1197
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.600
And then I Plus.

1198
01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.100
and rather

1199
01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.700
and these are going to correspond to the cells within

1200
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:12.900
 a matrix.

1201
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:14.400
so

1202
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800
Then we will have.

1203
01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.600
Ms. Sub

1204
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.400
IJ

1205
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.700
Is a colony cause means we're defining it. So.

1206
01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.300
If this was a python that you would

1207
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.800
 be critical variable or you would access a particular.

1208
01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.900
element within the multi-dimensional

1209
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.000
array, and then you will set it to

1210
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:51.900
this ratio

1211
01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:01.700
and AI

1212
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.900
Now what is M. What is M. Actually m is.

1213
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:14.500
a multiplier

1214
01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.600
M.

1215
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.100
Is called the multiplier.

1216
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.100
and

1217
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.600
we have our R is

1218
01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.000
 equal to

1219
01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.900
a scalar a scale or some

1220
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.700
so RJ equals

1221
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.700
i, j times r

1222
01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.800
plus r underscore

1223
01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.200
G

1224
01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.800
now I know I'm gonna run out of time before I do this. So as soon

1225
01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.800
 as the workshop is over. I'm going to show you the python implementation

1226
01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.100
 so we go from pseudocode.

1227
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.600
So we go from yeah we go from the pseudocode to the actual python

1228
01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.100
 implementation.

1229
01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:28.100
now

1230
01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.800
like I said, there's a numpy implementation for this but

1231
01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:41.000
I mean, it's not very helpful. If you just use every everything that's every black

1232
01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.400
 box method. You actually want to know what's going on the

1233
01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:43.500
 hood.

1234
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.600
What else do we have we have?

1235
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.900
It is this order. I'm not sure what it stands for our subject.

1236
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:55.900
It's the role.

1237
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:00.400
It's the row so where?

1238
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.100
There's the multiplier.

1239
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.500
in The

1240
01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.000
 Matrix a

1241
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.400
and what this will do.

1242
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.300
There's actually this is the L part and this should be a U

1243
01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:27.500
 part.

1244
01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:34.000
It will produce a matrix that looks like this. Let me

1245
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:34.500
 grab.

1246
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.100
some latex from the other

1247
01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:38.700
file

1248
01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:52.400
so I want this by the way this document from session

1249
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.500
 two has been updated. I've fixed a

1250
01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.600
 few mistakes added some comments.

1251
01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.100
So you'll be using this as reference for all of

1252
01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:04.400
 the other sessions and of course the assignments, so let

1253
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.400
 me grab this Matrix.

1254
01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.200
Oh, sorry. This is the one Matrix.

1255
01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.400
It will look something like so.

1256
01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:30.900
you will have

1257
01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.300
ones across the diagonal

1258
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.600
you have ones across the diagonal.

1259
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.300
0 elsewhere

1260
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:52.600
and

1261
01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.400
below the diagonal we will have the multipliers.

1262
01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:58.800
So this would be

1263
01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:01.300
minus m

1264
01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.400
2-1 where two is the row number one is

1265
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.800
 the column number.

1266
01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.100
And this would go on and on.

1267
01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.200
third row First Column

1268
01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.300
and then

1269
01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.600
all the way to to end

1270
01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:33.200
this would be in my end M sub n

1271
01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.900
 1.

1272
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.900
so the nth row

1273
01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:44.400
Okay.

1274
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.800
And so we need one on

1275
01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.700
 the diagonal.

1276
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.500
I need more columns. But anyway, I'll make this.

1277
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.200
Another multiplier. This would be

1278
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:10.500
 2.

1279
01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:16.400
And then the last one will be one.

1280
01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.000
It's messed up by the ideas this let me make

1281
01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:27.600
 this a zero.

1282
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.900
the point that the point I'm trying to make is this this algorithm that

1283
01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:36.500
 we sync up here is is going to help us to get to reduced

1284
01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.500
 row Echelon form

1285
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.400
 without having to

1286
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.100
If you if you saw in the linear programming example, we

1287
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.100
 had to man, you know, I had to do algebra.

1288
01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.700
And it took a while to just solve two

1289
01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:49.800
 equations.

1290
01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.500
and they were not and

1291
01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.600
there was no need for multiplying a term with

1292
01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.500
 one equation. It was just subtract subtract subtract.

1293
01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.100
But even with that it was time consuming it gets.

1294
01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.200
Much more time consuming once you add a third

1295
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.300
 equation.

1296
01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:14.900
And of course and like I said in real world problems, you could have multiple constraints

1297
01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.500
 or like five ten or so or even more constraints.

1298
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.400
 So we need something.

1299
01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:23.500
Some sort of methodical way to solve equation and

1300
01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.700
 this is really what I'm trying to get at.

1301
01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.700
this led composition

1302
01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.700
Okay now.

1303
01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.100
I have to finish I have to finish this file, but

1304
01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.100
 I'll add it to the dashboard once I'm done. So right after the works after

1305
01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:38.100
 I stopped the recording.

1306
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.100
You will find this under your dashboard. Just let me say this before

1307
01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.000
 we run at a time.

1308
01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.400
Going to come to the dashboard here.

1309
01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.000
linear mathematics

1310
01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.000
big number

1311
01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.700
first Zoom crashes and then the keyboard is Frozen

1312
01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:18.000
 now the URL doesn't open up.

1313
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:22.900
You know that Murphy's what is

1314
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:23.500
 it called Murphy's?

1315
01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:26.500
Murphy's Law

1316
01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.200
If something can go wrong, we'll go wrong. This is you're worth the

1317
01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.200
 sink it right now right here, but let's just let's just

1318
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.500
 give this a second to open up. Let me just

1319
01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.200
add my finishing my closing remarks and then we can add a

1320
01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:39.300
 session.

1321
01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.600
On a scale of what to five I want

1322
01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.000
 to do this again.

1323
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:52.200
How clear was this LP example for

1324
01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.800
 five Crystal Clear one?

1325
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:56.300
You know completely.

1326
01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.000
complete all over the place

1327
01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.100
Okay. Okay. This is very good.

1328
01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.400
Because it wasn't much interaction with just me going on a

1329
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.600
 monologue. But if it's if it was clear, that's that's great.

1330
01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.500
So you should make the assignment for module

1331
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.000
 would a lot easier why is this taking so long to load?

1332
01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:23.400
So, of course this third session will be the recording for

1333
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.600
 this will be live. By the way. I'm going to timestamp them.

1334
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.500
I know it's not to convenient to have to watch or move the

1335
01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.000
 scrub around so I'm going to timestamp the videos.

1336
01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:33.200
then

1337
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.200
you will see by the way. Yeah, and you will see the assignment for

1338
01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.900
 module one on by Saturday.

1339
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.500
So no later than salary you'll find the assignments. And of course it will be you have an

1340
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.300
 entire week to work on it.

1341
01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:48.600
Okay.

1342
01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.300
Any question comments?

1343
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.700
One of the things by the way, I'm gonna ask you is almost gonna post

1344
01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:57.300
 a survey.

1345
01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:00.700
On Saturday very just two

1346
01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:01.200
 or three questions.

1347
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.900
Because I want to see your suggestions for making things better.

1348
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.400
Obviously one of the things to make it better is not have to go through this but besides

1349
01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.600
 that anything that has to do with the material or delivery.

1350
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.300
I would welcome your suggestions very much.

1351
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:18.600
Okay.

1352
01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:21.900
No, I don't think the

1353
01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.500
I don't think the website wants to work today.

1354
01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.300
It's my connection like more likely not so much the

1355
01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:29.600
 website.

1356
01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.700
Now it's not going to work.

1357
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.600
Okay everybody. So I'll post I'll post

1358
01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.100
 these tutorial the stupid.

1359
01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:49.700
the completed

1360
01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.500
HTML tutorial of LED composition

1361
01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.200
and I'll have an update here on slack for the assignment.

1362
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.100
And documents for today, okay.

1363
01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:06.500
That's it for today's session everybody. Thank you so much for joining me

1364
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.200
 and I will see you on Monday.

1365
01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:10.000
Okay.

1366
01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.300
We're now take care of my.
