00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.400
Let me give you some context.

1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.300
By revisiting the systems of equity the

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.100
 system of equations we had from our last session.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.500
the linear programming problem remember the objective function

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.700
 and the

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.000
in the constraints

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.200
So I'm just going to copy those constraints.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.700
And this is what we had before.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.600
now if we the way we found the roots

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.400
 of these

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.900
Constraints was through classical algebra

11
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.300
 right move this term to the right side move that

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.300
 term to this side.

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.200
And then you know what algebra is about it's about limit. It's about

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.200
 simplifying it right cancellation canceling from both

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.000
 sides adding from adding to both sides reducing from

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.400
 both sides dividing Etc.

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.100
gaussian elimination

18
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.900
allows us to solve for the roots, but

19
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.300
Well that having to move the terms from one side

20
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.800
 to the next.

21
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400
and it is the stepping stone to get into LED composition

22
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.800
 which

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.300
I don't want to say simplifies, but

24
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.600
Makes the process more efficient.

25
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.300
So what we're going to look at is solving systems of equations.

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.600
more efficiently

27
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100
anyway to represent this.

28
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.300
these two inequalities

29
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.300
and of course what we did in

30
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.500
the lp problem was to express these as equations.

31
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.800
but

32
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.000
it would get this.

33
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.100
Matrix

34
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.200
so obviously we would not bring the variables in here.

35
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500
 We would know what variables these numbers stand

36
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 for because if we follow the order right 100x, so

37
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.900
 that's 100 is of social with that X.

38
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.800
This 100 is associated with that why you get the idea?

39
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.400
And the reason I put these parentheses is so that you know that you know, I

40
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.600
 did it really for this for this term.

41
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.500
So he know that the this is one number.

42
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.600
This is one number.

43
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.600
Okay. Now this is called an augmented Matrix.

44
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.800
It's called augmented because

45
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.600
this Matrix is actually the

46
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.100
 union of

47
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.100
Two The Matrix for what's on the left

48
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.700
 side of the inequality inequalities? And what's on

49
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.800
 the right side of the inequalities?

50
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.100
So

51
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.600
augmented matrices would also be denoted like

52
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.800
 so

53
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.900
you could put a vertical bar.

54
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.800
I could put

55
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.200
some latex here to space them out a

56
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.300
 little bit.

57
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.000
So let me show you how we would go about solving this.

58
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.400
system of inequalities with gaussian elimination

59
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.900
so here

60
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.300
and I'll come back to why I even brought up augmented

61
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.300
 matrices because it has to with LED composition when we

62
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.200
 do LED composition.

63
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200
We separate.

64
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.800
the

65
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.300
terms on the left side of the equation and the terms of

66
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.700
 the right side of the equation, okay?

67
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.400
So, let me let me get I'll come

68
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.200
 back to this idea later.

69
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.500
Okay, I'll come back this.

70
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.400
so this is

71
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.900
representing

72
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.200
inequalities

73
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.300
Or even equations for that matter. It doesn't really matter.

74
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.800
with or

75
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.500
in a system of equity in a system

76
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.400
equations

77
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.300
just

78
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.000
in a matrix
