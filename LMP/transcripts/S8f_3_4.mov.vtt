00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.800
for step 3 we must

1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.900
find the roots remember, this is the variable.

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.700
And we want to know what this will be equal to.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.200
so we just solve for Lambda and

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.600
 we will get

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.600
two

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.000
lambdas

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.600
eigenvalue 1 eigenvalue 2

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.600
Those are your two eigenvalues.

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.700
Okay.

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.100
So to find the roots of the characteristic polymers to find

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.400
 the eigenvalues now that we have the eigenvalues we can go ahead and find the

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.200
 eigenvector for our Matrix.

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.400
So step 4 would be.

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.100
to Now find the eigen

15
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.400
vectors so

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.300
we have

17
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.100
this expression

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.200
so we want

19
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.900
This equation a Lambda equals

20
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.400
 B. I don't I I don't think even I

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.800
 can see it but this is supposed to be the vector. It's slightly.

22
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.100
more dense

23
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400
and those are the eigenvalues.

24
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.200
It's not that clear just let's keep that in

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.600
 mind. Okay, so a is going to be a matrix B is

26
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.400
 going to be a vector and this is the eigenvector.

27
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.300
For emphasis. These are the eigenvalues.

28
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.600
These must go in there.

29
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.600
Okay. So how do we find the eigenvectors? We

30
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.900
 do this we take our original Matrix?

31
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.900
a

32
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.300
And we multiplied by.

33
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.700
a vector with unknown quantities

34
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.100
step one except two

35
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.500
this will then turn it into a system of

36
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.900
 equations.

37
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.000
system of linear equations right because none of these

38
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200
Are they're all I mean these values are raised

39
00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.600
 to the power one.

40
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.500
And this will be cool to the vector.

41
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.400
0 0

42
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.500
so we want

43
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.100
to find the values for x

44
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.600
that will make this matrix multiplication. Give

45
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.800
 us a vector zero zero.

46
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.100
Now, what does this if we were to convert this

47
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.500
 into a matrix? What we what what would we get?

48
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.900
We would get the following system of equations.

49
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.900
to want to just so we actually want

50
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.500
a minus 1 Lambda

51
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.100
a minus 1 Lambda. So we want this Matrix multiplied

52
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.000
 by the eigenvector.

53
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.500
So this should become.

54
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.900
times

55
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.500
the vector Lambda

56
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.700
okay, because here we

57
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.000
Took the determinant of a minus Lambda and

58
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.500
 the idea. Well, this is it. So

59
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.500
same thing we've done up here.

60
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.400
First we took the determinant of this Matrix.

61
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.100
now we are taking the

62
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.000
now we're solving for.

63
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.200
the eigenvector

64
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.200
of this Matrix

65
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.400
So this Matrix actually become.

66
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.800
Two two one three, so

67
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.300
 to find the wagon Vector must

68
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.700
 find the actor for specific eigenvalue.

69
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.200
So I will denote.

70
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.800
these as sub 1 and sub 2

71
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.100
these are the two Roots we found.

72
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.400
So let's first solve for let me

73
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.100
 make them. Let me make this two and make this one because I want to

74
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.100
 follow the own sequence I have here. Anyway, this is

75
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.000
 the first route. This is the second root.

76
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.200
Okay, so we're gonna find the actor eigenvectors for

77
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200
 lamb this up one.

78
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.300
Which means that we must evaluate this

79
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.500
 Matrix so 2 minus.

80
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.200
One will make this.

81
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.400
one

82
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.400
then this Remains Two.

83
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.200
This remains 1 and 3 minus 1 is just 2.

84
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.900
 So this becomes 2.

85
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.200
Okay, so this after we plug

86
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.900
 in one for these?

87
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.700
Variables evaluate the expressions and evaluate

88
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.000
 these differences.

89
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.200
And we will get this Matrix. We turn

90
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.000
 this into a system of a linear equations. We will get

91
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.200
the following

92
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.900
two equations we will have

93
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.400
if you remember from our last session, we eliminated one of these so

94
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.800
 we can just

95
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.600
Take one of them.

96
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.100
and solve for x sub 1

97
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.600
 and x sub 2

98
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.600
so x sub 1

99
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.200
negative 2 x sub 2 if we

100
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.700
 do the algebra, we'll become one.

101
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.300
Okay, so, you know, you know the whole story.

102
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.800
moving X up to another side

103
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.300
and then moving except one other side we get these two roots.

104
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.600
So we don't need to have this repetition we can just keep one of those systems since the

105
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.900
 identical.

106
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.200
and solving or x sub

107
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.400
 1 and x sub 2

108
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.100
Now that we have x sub 1 and x sub 2 we will be know

109
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.100
 the components of the eigenvector.

110
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.300
So we know we can plug in these numbers we can plug in minus 2

111
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.700
 or minus 1.

112
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.800
in here

113
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.700
Now here, we also need something called a basis.

114
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.200
So we need the eigenvector for

115
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.100
 the first eigenvalid and the eigenvector of the second eigenvalue to

116
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.700
 put them together inside a matrix because we're

117
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.300
 not just solving for the eigenvectors. We're actually trying

118
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.000
 to get to diagonalization. So we're not quite done yet.

119
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.000
which is why I will create a

120
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.600
Vector here and we will use V

121
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.000
 sub 1 so V sub 1 is

122
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.500
 going to be

123
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.200
the vector

124
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.900
with the roots we have just found.

125
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.100
We will put this eigenvector and the second

126
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.900
 one inside.

127
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.100
A matrix so these will become the columns.

128
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.500
of The Matrix
