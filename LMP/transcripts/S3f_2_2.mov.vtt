00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.000
So for tasks number one.

1
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.700
We kind of did this in session one?

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.400
We must find the roots.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.400
Of the constraint of the constraint functions or the

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.400
 constraint equations.

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.100
To find a point outlining the feasible region.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.200
So we have two constraints and both by the way in in LP

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.500
 problems the objective function and

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.000
 their constraints are all linear meaning they produce lines.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.300
So we're not going to look at quadratic equations

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.400
 every variable in the

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.200
 lp all variables in the end. The lp problem

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.700
 will have will be raised to the power one.

13
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.800
Not more than that.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.300
Okay.

15
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.600
so

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.600
the first constraint is going to produce one line

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.300
 the other conceptual produce another line and

18
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.800
 then we need to

19
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.300
well find the region that does not.

20
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.300
Overlap into the other region you'll see exactly what

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.700
 this means once we start plotting.

22
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.000
All right.

23
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100
Now what we need to do is of course.

24
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.800
to solve this

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.200
you must explain the constraints which are currently inequalities.

26
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.900
And express them as equations.

27
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.900
So we have the following two equations.

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.600
So you can see.

29
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.800
and remember 200x

30
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.500
X is the number of

31
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.800
the premium containers

32
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.700
why is the variable corresponding to the standard containers?

33
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.300
So this is constraint one. This is

34
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.800
 constraint to

35
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.700
in order to find the reason we have to solve for x and y

36
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.300
so first

37
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.300
now, of course we could put these two equations into a

38
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.200
 matrix and then do

39
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.300
gaussian elimination

40
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.100
but this is only two equations so we can

41
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.500
 just do something simple. So we have equation 1 and equation

42
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.800
 two subtract them subtract first equation from the up the

43
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.000
 one below and then we can simplify it to more.

44
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.600
 So 200 minus 100 gives us 100 x

45
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.800
100 why my minus 100 y that

46
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.600
 just gives us 0 y

47
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200
now, of course this wouldn't appear in the equation, but I'm just putting it here.

48
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.400
 So, you know that this is not eliminated.

49
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.500
And of course 4,000 minus 3,000 is 1,000.

50
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.300
So again, we're getting we're getting closer to finding

51
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.500
 the most points of the feasible, which I only did this and I

52
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.300
 know this is not precise, you know, we should keep the units of

53
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.100
 measurement we should keep but but I did

54
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.000
 that intentionally just to

55
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.100
because tuning out to me too many numbers.

56
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.200
 I thought we simply but anyway, we'll keep this.

57
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.400
It's a good thing you brought it up.

58
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.600
We simplified. So right now we have to find what

59
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.700
 x is equal to and what Y is equal to.

60
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.000
by

61
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.900
performing some classical algebra Elementary algebra.

62
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.500
 So first we find X.

63
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.500
So y goes out of the picture.

64
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.800
And we divide 100.

65
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.200
We divide both sides of the equation by a 100 so I

66
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.100
 can let me just simplify. It makes up think so that I

67
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.500
 clear here.

68
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600
This zero would go away.

69
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.100
And then we would have to get 100 to go on the other

70
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.300
 side.

71
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.600
and then this of course if you want to keep

72
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.600
our scientific notation

73
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.700
okay, and then

74
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.800
I'm just gonna leave this out for now. Okay, because I'm gonna

75
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.500
 I'm gonna confuse myself as well. But here

76
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.300
 we know where we this implies that this is actually

77
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.400
100 times 10 to the power 4

78
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.900
Okay.

79
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.700
I'll leave a note here node.

80
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.800
here

81
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.900
10,000 is actually

82
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.200
times 10

83
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.000
power 4

84
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.700
Anyway X is equal to 10.

85
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.600
Quick comment here when we say 10. We

86
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.400
 shouldn't forget that. This is 10 times.

87
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.700
10 to the power of 4

88
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.200
so X is actually equal to

89
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.200
100,000

90
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.500
so we found our first root.

91
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.400
now what we do is now that we know what x is we plug it in we plug

92
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.900
 in x

93
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.800
for the other equation

94
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.300
so then we get

95
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.400
this bit

96
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.200
so we call this.

97
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.800
and then

98
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.300
solving four y

99
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.300
So what we have done here.

100
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.800
Is we've taken equation number.

101
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.400
that's 100 y so this equation to

102
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.900
equation 2

103
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.200
agent

104
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.300
so here

105
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.800
we have

106
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.400
3000 again here with this implies

107
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.700
 that it's

108
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.500
you know.

109
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.500
30 million

110
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.300
and

111
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.300
let me just make sure I didn't leave anything out by mistake.

112
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.600
I think I did.

113
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.000
Yeah, I was supposed to bring this here.

114
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.100
So we take equation two.

115
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.200
We take the 10 this 10 over here.

116
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.300
Right. That's our root for X the value for the root

117
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.500
 X.

118
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.600
And then we plug it in into equation too. So

119
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.100
 this becomes 100 times 10.

120
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.300
Plus 100y equals 3,000 or actually

121
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.100
 30 million.

122
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.800
And that's exactly what we've done here.

123
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.800
Okay again, just to be consistent with the notation.

124
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.500
 I am going to

125
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.100
There we go. Like so

126
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.600
again, I don't want you to be too fixated on the

127
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.200
units of measurement or the scale the proportions.

128
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.100
 I just want you to see that the idea here is we have

129
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.100
 two inequalities to express them as equation and then we solve for

130
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.700
 x and y to find a point that is the key thing here.

131
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.100
So we do some algebraic management manipulation right here. We

132
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.100
 have 100 y. So in order to

133
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.200
 move with this term to the right side,

134
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.300
 we substrate we subtract it. So 100 times 10. That's

135
00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.700
 a thousand.

136
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.200
So now we get 3,000 from up here.

137
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.000
Minus 1,000 so it is

138
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.400
 this move the right side of the equation.

139
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.300
Subtracting these two we get two thousand. All right, it's actually supposed

140
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.900
 to be you know, 20 million.

141
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.800
And then we divide.

142
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.600
we divide 200 over 100 because

143
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.200
you know, this is where we're getting the 100 from right? It's this one.

144
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.800
this 100

145
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.300
will bring it we divide both sides by 100 and it

146
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.700
 gives us 20.

147
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.300
So in other words the root for

148
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.000
 X is 10.

149
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.300
And for why it's 20 which gives us this point.

150
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.700
Now what I want to show you.

151
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.500
is

152
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.200
Plotting part 1. So again, we have we have

153
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.200
 done part 1 so far or should this task one, which

154
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.000
 is finding the feasible region of the objective function.

155
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.100
So I'm going to switch to python out to show you how it's done

156
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.500
 with python how we will use matplotlib to plot this.

157
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.100
And that will return to find the best point for the

158
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.500
 objective function.

159
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.900
And that is the point.

160
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.600
In the feasible region that will maximize the profit.
