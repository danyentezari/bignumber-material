00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.500
So I will now extend this code

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
 to create a three-dimensional plot.

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.100
Okay, I'm going to collapse this

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.500
 create a new section.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.200
And this will be called.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.200
vectors in 3D

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.000
So I've introducing to this code because we're going to

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.600
 later use this for more advanced examples.

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.700
Okay.

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.700
Let me just copy the code.

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.200
So these are the same functions we

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.700
 saw before but for three dimensions.

12
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.000
same as before, but now we have a z Axis or a

13
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.400
You know a linear space for the points along the

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.100
 Z axis.

15
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.800
And of course, we're now adding a third.

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.000
list in this Tuple

17
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.100
to the points on

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.500
The three axes so same function just adapted

19
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 for three dimensions.

20
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.400
and if I want to create

21
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.300
one vector in this three-dimensional

22
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.600
just coordinate system.

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.100
So for example 10 on the X and Y

24
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.000
 and Z axis would get something that looks like.

25
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.200
Like this, let me copy the figure information.

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.800
right

27
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.500
So this is the x-axis.

28
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.100
You can see if we look at it from the x-axis.

29
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.400
If I follow this Gray Line go all

30
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.800
 the way here.

31
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.300
It is 10 points away from

32
00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.700
 the 10.

33
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.500
from the x-axis

34
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.500
case maybe here

35
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.900
then on the y-axis same thing.

36
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.700
on the y-axis

37
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.400
And of course the Z axis.

38
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.200
So you can have to imagine this is in a

39
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.100
 three-dimensional space.

40
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.200
right

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.200
And of course we can probably second one.

42
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.400
Let's change this to.

43
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.000
20 on the z-axis, for example

44
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.200
So going forward we're going to use this code to draw.

45
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.400
vectors needed two or three dimensions

46
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.000
Okay. So the orange one obvious second Vector is higher.

47
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.200
And now this one goes up to 15. So let's make

48
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.400
 these point on the z-axis 15.

49
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.600
Okay, so going forward we're going to use this source code.

50
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.300
Now, let me show you.

51
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.500
practical example

52
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.200
But now with vector addition because I think

53
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.000
 outside of outside of physics. I can't come up with any

54
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.100
practical example, so I'm just going

55
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.500
 to turn our attention to

56
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.200
the polar coordinate system

57
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.400
We will talk about the polar coordinate system.

58
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.100
the magnitude of a vector

59
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.100
and then once we have the the magnitude we will also look

60
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.200
 at

61
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.100
scalar multiplication

62
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.200
And then once we've covered these three, yeah, so

63
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.600
 the polar coordinate system magnitude of

64
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.100
 a vector scale of multiplication and then we can

65
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.800
 Implement cosine similar. It would be cool to plot the

66
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.500
 rotate space. Yeah what there's a

67
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.400
 greater library, but not math plot that

68
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.000
 math problem is flat if you want to interactive one. There's something called.

69
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.200
I think Seaborn does it

70
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.200
 but there's also one called plot the I really like I really like this Library.

71
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.500
So if I could apply for python

72
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.800
Let me just Google pull probably 3D.

73
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.100
plot

74
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.200
It's a very simple to use Library when it comes in JavaScript. So

75
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.600
You know, you can create. Yeah, this is the one.

76
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.900
This is very cool. We can take snapshots of it.

77
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.200
You take that's a snapshot.

78
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.700
You can zoom in pan.

79
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.300
And maybe I'll give you the source code for using this Library. It's pretty

80
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.400
 straightforward by them. Nothing spectacles. It's very analogous to

81
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.600
matplotlib

82
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.600
so the same convention, you know.

83
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.000
You well this well, you need a daily frame. So this is

84
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.500
 going to be the list of values and then so DF stands for data frame

85
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.400
 and the data frame is simply a table.

86
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.900
X and Y points. So the left column would be the X points. Why

87
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.800
 kind of would be the white points?

88
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.000
Yeah, and you can also have you know, like

89
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.200
a

90
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.100
He density.

91
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.700
It's a bit finicky to play around but this is this is one option.
