00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.600
So here's the background.

1
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.400
We have a imaginary country.

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.900
that exports

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Grains, like wheat and barley we call countries

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.200
 like this that export.

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.300
So a coffee beans like essential food

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.300
 items to other countries a bread basket.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.000
Okay.

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.000
So when it comes to wheat, it's you know, Russia, Ukraine.

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.600
other countries in Eastern Europe many countries

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.300
 depend on the Imports of these countries,

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.500
 so

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.100
you may have heard the news right now that the price of

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.900
Bread has gone up and this is problematic in

14
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.200
 many countries where bread?

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.100
is the main

16
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.700
food of consumption the price goes up and that just

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.800
 drives the price of many things up. It's coincidence.

18
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.100
 Now, this is the problem because this is the one I found in the

19
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.200
 book, but I adapt it.

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
To make it, you know rather relevant to what we

21
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.800
 know what we're hearing the news today. Anyway, we have this country that

22
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.200
 exports great to other countries.

23
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.900
And they need to ship.

24
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.700
there there

25
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.300
they're great. So there is another there's a

26
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.700
 state-owned manufacturer a government-owned company that produces

27
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.400
 containers we call these container liners.

28
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200
 They look something like this.

29
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.400
so, you know you put these in the cargo like

30
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.100
 they want to find in mirk, but these are you know meant to

31
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.500
 keep

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.300
the grain dry

33
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.500
It's just for cargo, okay?

34
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.300
now they have

35
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.800
two types

36
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.900
two designs two models

37
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.500
one is the standard model.

38
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.600
And the other one is the premium. So what's

39
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.800
what how are they different?

40
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.600
Okay, and of course, we we didn't know the standard container

41
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.500
 would C sub s and the premium one would see sub

42
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.200
 pieces the C stands for container.

43
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.600
So the standard container can contain 100 kilograms

44
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.000
 of barley and 100 kilograms of wheat.

45
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.300
Or as a premium one can hold 200 kilograms of

46
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.900
 barley and 100 kilograms of wheat.

47
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.800
I am not an expert in agriculture, but

48
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.100
Apparently you can design containers this way. You can mix it together.

49
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.300
Now this company the state

50
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.200
 owned manufacturer now, it doesn't matter if it's date on a private.

51
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.400
 It's just

52
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.200
Then the numbers here and the variables are important for

53
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.700
 us this company. This manufacturer has received a

54
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.000
 quote.

55
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.500
to sell or provide

56
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.300
the government with containers

57
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.800
for the following

58
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.000
the manufacturer is supposed to produce continuous for 30 million

59
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.600
 tons of Wheat and

60
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.800
 40 million tons of barley. Now I've used

61
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.100
This notation because when it comes to

62
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.400
 plotting it will become easier. So we're going to actually drop the units of

63
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.700
 measurement.

64
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.200
So we will stick to 300 to 4000 not just for

65
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.400
 context it. They export

66
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.900
 in the millions in the millions of tons.

67
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.500
now

68
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.500
what we want what what this LP problem is about is

69
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.600
 maximizing the profit margin for

70
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.200
 the company.

71
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.300
What combination of containers can we use to maximize the

72
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.800
 profit?

73
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.600
So they will earn 80 cents of the dollar.

74
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.700
if they sell

75
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.900
premium containers and 70 cents for

76
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.300
the standard container

77
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.400
Okay.

78
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.700
and

79
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.400
what we need to do first is Express the

80
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.100
 objective function.

81
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.400
So basically we need to model the relationship between

82
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.100
 how of how much they will make.

83
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.600
and

84
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.400
then maximize this function.

85
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.200
So this is the objective function.

86
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.400
Okay.

87
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.600
Let me copy this bit here.

88
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.700
There's a lot of information going on in here, right? So let's

89
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.300
 break it down. I'll break it down. Okay, just

90
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.400
 give you some background first.

91
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.000
So let me actually put these up here.

92
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.200
Because I don't want to these are not the same. This is a

93
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.400
 different task. So this is the problem.

94
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.900
tasks

95
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.400
and then there's the lp tasks.

96
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.200
So the objective function is the following the

97
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.400
 objective function is this

98
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.900
they will earn 80 cents.

99
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.700
For every premium container that they that they

100
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.200
 sell to the government.

101
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.400
And 70 cents where we

102
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.900
 stand a container.

103
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.600
That they sell.

104
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.400
So the objective function is a function of two

105
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.400
 variables.

106
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.200
the number of Premium containers and the number of standard containers

107
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.600
not good for convenience.

108
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.200
We're going to swap.

109
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.400
C sub p and C Sub C with X and Y.

110
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.700
 It's just notational convenience. So

111
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.600
 we will let x equal to the premium the number

112
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.300
 of Premium containers and Y equals

113
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.500
 to the number of

114
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.300
standard containers

115
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.800
So this is the objective function now.

116
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.500
It is a function of two variables.

117
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800
And this is the relationship.

118
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.100
Now we want to maximize this.

119
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.700
But we have constraints.

120
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.100
We have this constraints.

121
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.300
What are the constraints let's see.

122
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.100
The constraints are the following.

123
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.300
the first one

124
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.800
now these constraints say that then the

125
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.000
 combination of containers you use the number of

126
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.400
 continues use cannot exceed.

127
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.000
the amount that you are allocated

128
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.700
So for example in the for wheat, we

129
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.700
 have 30 million tons.

130
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.500
So we need to I mean, yeah, so

131
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.600
 we cannot exceed.

132
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.400
Whenever we when we solve for this equation, we plotted

133
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.500
 we cannot exceed the quantity.

134
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.800
And of course the below what is for the barley?

135
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.300
These constraints will once we plotted and you

136
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.500
 know solve for the roots the X and y's.

137
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.300
We will know up to what number of standard or to

138
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.100
 what up to what number of Premium containers we can you know, we can

139
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.700
 we can adjust.

140
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.500
So the tasks are this.

141
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.700
Given the objective function. So let's now

142
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.300
 this is our new objective function the one that's f of

143
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.400
 x

144
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.300
this is the objective function.

145
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.600
And these are the constraints.

146
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.800
tasks number one

147
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.600
We need to find the feasible region.

148
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.900
for the objective function

149
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.400
and then find the best point.

150
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.500
within that region

151
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.200
so we need to know what are the limitations of our parameters and

152
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.800
 then within the within the

153
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.200
within the region

154
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.100
For a parameters. What is the most what is the point? I'll give us

155
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.500
 maximum profit.

156
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.900
Okay, this is only two constraints.

157
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.600
But then we can generalize it for problems where

158
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600
 we have multiple constraints.
