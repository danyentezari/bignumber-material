00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.600
so here

1
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.800
we have our solar systems. Now. How would we solve this?

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.400
again to solve a system

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.900
is to have

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.800
an upper triangle

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.100
an upper triangle looks like this.

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.300
This is the upper trying right? This is the

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.800
 other triangle.

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.800
You have a leading zeros.

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.100
Under their main or what we call the principal diagonal.

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.700
So every number to the right or above the principal

11
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.400
 diagonal is a non-zero value.

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.200
and everything obviously below that

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.400
 is a

14
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.700
is a zero.

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.600
So this is called Echelon 4 this whole

16
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.000
 Matrix, but that is called the upper. This is the

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.400
 upper triangle.

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.900
now

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.600
to solve for the roots of

20
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 the inequalities

21
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.100
the numbers

22
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.600
of the upper triangle most also be once

23
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.400
So this would be one one one and you

24
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.100
 know, everything else that we would be zero.

25
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.300
Okay, so for Led composition, we don't need to make

26
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.800
 these ones.

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.100
But when we do gaussian elimination, we do what these to

28
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.900
 be once. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that this is upper triangle.

29
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.700
Okay, so we need to get our inequality our

30
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 system rather in Upper triangular form and then

31
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.000
 get these.

32
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.700
What why do we just also called pivots the numbers across

33
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.500
 the principal diagonal

34
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.400
 called pivots? We need to make these pivots equal to one.

35
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.300
So let me show you and of course. This is a

36
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.500
this is reduced. Well reduce row

37
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.400
 Echelon form. So once we get the pivots across

38
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.500
 the diagonal equal to one we have then achieved reduced row

39
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 Echelon form.

40
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.900
I'm going to keep this picture as reference.

41
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.100
so

42
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.900
Okay.

43
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.800
one one

44
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.000
so, let's see how we can do this equation. So I'm going to

45
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.700
 copy it again.

46
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.400
And paste it.
