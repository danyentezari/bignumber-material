00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.500
module 3 is going to be about

1
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.900
all the linear algebra ideas

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.700
that will

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.800
allow us to understand singular validity

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.200
 composition.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.400
And then from their PCA.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.700
I've seen in several books where they

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.500
 say SVD is like the jewel.

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400
Of linear algebra, they actually use that word.

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.200
And Gilbert Strang, you know famous Professor at

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.700
 MIT set SVD is one of the one

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.900
 of the high points or the highest point of linear algebra.

12
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.300
and it is a

13
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.300
the SVD that really requires us to

14
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.400
 know.

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.200
I won't say the entirety of linear algebra, but a

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.800
 lot of linear algebra. So in order for us to

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.300
extract the sink these things we call the singular

18
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.800
 values from Matrix.

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.300
We need to know.

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700
Well everything we've covered up this point everything will cover today.

21
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.000
and

22
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.700
Our next session on Wednesday. I think we can get into SVD

23
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.000
 by Wednesday.

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.200
And PC with that's applications on

25
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.500
 Friday.

26
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.200
But yeah, so we want to see the

27
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.400
 prerequisites of

28
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.800
SVD

29
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.300
in this session. So today which is

30
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.300
 the 11th of July.

31
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.400
You want to start with the following?

32
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.700
let me pull out that slide from

33
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.100
our very first session

34
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.200
so this module is about

35
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.500
this

36
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.100
working our way up to PC and

37
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100
 from there looking at its application this we will do.

38
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100
in module 4

39
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.200
this we will do on Friday.

40
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.200
And this way I guess because this could be we can look at

41
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.300
 this.

42
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.100
okay, so this will borrow this will be

43
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.200
 based on systems of

44
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.700
linear equations, but this one for sure.

45
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.400
Is an application of PCA?

46
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.300
For this we would need some background on neural networks. But you know

47
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.400
 now that we've covered a lot of Matrix operations. We

48
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.300
 really we will prepare for neural networks.

49
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.200
So we are going to do pattern recognition using your Networks.

50
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.800
Okay. So today we're going to talk about the determinant

51
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.000
 function.

52
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.500
First for a 2 by 2 Matrix and then by for

53
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.800
 three by three Matrix and then we're going to talk about eigenvalues and

54
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.300
 eigenvectors.

55
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.000
How we go about calculating these?

56
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.800
If time allows it, I also want to talk about the inversion

57
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.400
 of a matrix.

58
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.300
Because that will also later be used.

59
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.500
and then

60
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.200
Again, if we can get past Target values academic actors fast enough,

61
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.500
 we can always talk about the characters polynomial so that on

62
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.400
 Wednesday we talk about SVD.

63
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.300
And it's and PC just a special case of

64
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.800
 SVD.

65
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.300
So understanding this we're only a few steps away from PC.

66
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.100
 Although we have talked about something called normalization.

67
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.000
but

68
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.100
that's not a big deal. It's it's something trivial. We will you know,

69
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.800
 we can manage.

70
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.600
Okay, so we will start first with the determinant of a

71
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.300
 matrix deter.

72
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.600
minant of a matrix

73
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.800
then we will look at eigen Computing the eigen.

74
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.000
vectors

75
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.500
And I can values.

76
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.200
and then characteristic

77
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.100
polynomial

78
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.100
and then if time allows it in version of a matrix.

79
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.500
Okay.

80
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.000
This will be tutorial number but 12.

81
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.000
as we

82
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500
so the determinant of a matrix

83
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.400
preliminaries

84
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
or

85
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.400
SVD

86
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.900
Time is type. That word.

87
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.700
There we go.

88
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.400
Other correction has really

89
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.300
messed up my spelling.

90
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.200
capabilities

91
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.900
Thank you zoom out here.

92
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.600
Okay, so first we'll begin with determinant.

93
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.100
The permanent this should be

94
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.800
 your camera determinant.

95
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.300
A matrix now, of course, we can only calculate determinant office

96
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.300
 of matrices that are square.

97
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.400
So consider the following example, this is very straightforward and we have

98
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.200
 a matrix.

99
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.200
Let's say let me just click copy paste the code to save

100
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.300
 time from typing.

101
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.900
All right. So let's say we have a square Matrix.

102
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.400
But I'm just going to substitute the values here with the

103
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.200
 letters a because the numbers are important. It's the operation that's important.

104
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.400
So this will be

105
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.000
a

106
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.100
sub 1 1

107
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.100
so first row First Column

108
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.700
This would be second row First Column third row First

109
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.000
 Column.

110
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.200
And that's actually begin with the two by

111
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.300
 two.

112
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.200
So I'm just going to keep this two by two.

113
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.300
first row second column

114
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.200
second row second column

115
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.800
the determinant of a matrix

116
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.700
Is denoted by Det?

117
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.600
and

118
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.200
to compute the

119
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.700
determinant of a

120
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.500
square Matrix is to

121
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.500
Took the product.

122
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.100
of the components across

123
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.400
the diagonal

124
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.300
this is only true for the square major for two by two. I'll show you how it's not

125
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.900
 worth 2 by 3.

126
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.300
Take the product of a a sub 1

127
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.700
 1 and a sub 2 2 so across this diagonal.

128
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.400
Then take the product.

129
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.800
Of the opposite diagonal or the opposite direction and then

130
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.400
 sum them.

131
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.100
so determinant of a two by two Matrix is

132
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.100
And so the first component well, I mean you can

133
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.900
 see here. So these two plus

134
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.400
these two

135
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.000
let's put these in parentheses for clarity.

136
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.300
Okay, and it will become.

137
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.600
like so

138
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.200
second row

139
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.800
A11 a this is incorrect. This is

140
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.600
a11 a22

141
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.100
a12

142
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.100
And a two one.

143
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:33.900
There we go.

144
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.200
That's the determinant for a

145
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.200
hold on a second. I did I stop.

146
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.300
It's a difference different. I think one of you left to

147
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:55.400
 come with.

148
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.300
Oh, hi there. We do. It's the difference. Not the

149
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.600
 sum.

150
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:02.700
That's the difference.

151
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.900
All right, three by three or yeah for

152
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.100
 a three by three or larger.

153
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:12.300
Let me

154
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.700
let me let me show you how it's done.

155
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.700
I'm going to this so this is for us. This is for our two by two four.

156
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.000
2 by 2 Matrix

157
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.300
for three by three

158
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.300
we kind of have the argument as Matrix.

159
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.000
Something like this, so I'm going to copy this bit again.

160
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.900
Okay, so let's add one more Row one more column.

161
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.200
So this would become.

162
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.000
a13

163
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.600
This would become a two three.

164
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.000
and

165
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.900
We have one more row, so.

166
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.000
First Column of the third row

167
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.100
second column of the third row third column of the

168
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:31.600
 third rule.

169
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:32.600
now

170
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.800
to calculate this

171
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.200
maybe augment this let me copy paste the same

172
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.100
 Matrix. So becomes e visually easier to

173
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.900
See, I'm gonna copy that bit.

174
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.600
And I'm going to copy it once more.

175
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.700
And let me actually put them next to each other.

176
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.100
Okay, let's put some line break.

177
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.700
in order to calculate the determinant of

178
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.400
the three by three

179
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.300
we're going to multiply.

180
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.200
again

181
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.300
everything across the diagonal so this times this

182
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.500
times this

183
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.500
so the third column of the third row.

184
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.100
But then we also have to multiply these components.

185
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.100
And those components so on the upper drawing of the lower triangle. How

186
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.400
 do we do this?

187
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.000
Well, the reason I augmented this Matrix is because we want to

188
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.900
 multiply three components three components three components. So

189
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.000
 after Computing the elements

190
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.100
 across the main diagonal then we're going

191
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.100
 to multiply a12.

192
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.500
times a two three

193
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.900
and then a three one.

194
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.800
So this element?

195
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.200
I'll come all the way up here.

196
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.600
Maybe let me also just show you this from

197
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.800
 a different angle. So I'm going to type in determinant.

198
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.200
of a three by three Matrix

199
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:20.600
Okay.

200
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.100
So some of them use these arrows which I think

201
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.600
 are helpful.

202
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.400
Let's use yeah, here we go.

203
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.100
So this is this this is a three by three which has been

204
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.700
 argumented.

205
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:36.600
Okay.

206
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.900
So we multiply the products across the main diagonal.

207
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.100
And then we have B sub 1 C sub 2.

208
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.600
Which we wanted me to multiply with a sub three. So we're

209
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.200
 going to copy a sub three all the way here. I mean that's all point of

210
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.500
 mirroring.

211
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.500
Or reflecting if you want this Matrix so

212
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.000
 we can have this.

213
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.800
business this diagonal business

214
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.600
And then once we've done it from there, once we've done the

215
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.200
 cross the main dial will go the other direction. So see sub 1

216
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.400
 B sub 2 a sub 3

217
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.200
and then a sub 1 is up to so

218
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.700
 basically the exactly what I just said.

219
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.400
Okay.

220
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.300
These elements these elements and these elements. So you

221
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.600
 see when we when we copy The Matrix now in

222
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.100
 the examples, I showed you an example you will see they will

223
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:26.800
 leave the spit out.

224
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.600
But I think it's just more clear if I make a duplicate.

225
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.800
Okay, so if I copy

226
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:35.600
this part

227
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.400
the determinant of a three by three would be

228
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.700
a11822833

229
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.900
a33

230
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.800
right, a11822833

231
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.100
and

232
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.100
that will be minus.

233
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.100
A12 a23 and then a three one.

234
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.100
So you want to

235
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.800
a21

236
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.300
or 823

237
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.100
and then a three one.

238
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.100
I'm gonna go and type this this will take forever.

239
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.800
But hopefully now you get the idea.

240
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:25.600
Okay.

241
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.100
So let's look at an example.

242
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.000
Just the two by two.

243
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.000
And then we'll move on to the next topic.

244
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:37.800
So let's say

245
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.100
we have

246
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.900
the square Matrix. I'm going to copy paste.

247
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.100
code

248
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.600
and let's say we have

249
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.700
You know, whatever this will be for.

250
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.200
This will be three.

251
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.400
This will be eight.

252
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.000
And let's make this two.

253
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.200
so two times three minus 8 times 2

254
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.500
So we have two.

255
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.500
times three

256
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.600
minus

257
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:28.500
8

258
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.300
times 2

259
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.300
and what will this evaluate to there? So that will be six minus 16.

260
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.000
so negative 10

261
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.700
That's the determinant of this Matrix.

262
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.100
Now we leave this here and come back to it.

263
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.100
To well, of course for every concept that

264
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.500
 we see here. We want to know what's what's

265
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.200
A practically example of using the determined. So let's keep this year

266
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.900
 so we can refer to later on.

267
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.800
Okay, this was determinate.

268
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.400
now the next topic is

269
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.300
eigenvectors eigenvalues

270
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.200
This is going to be this is going to take a couple of

271
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:10.500
 minutes.

272
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.000
So that I can show you the whole process of.

273
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.300
calculating the eigenvalues

274
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.900
of a particular Square Matrix, and

275
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.200
 we will we will need to

276
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.200
We will need to know the determinant is and we just

277
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.300
 have found out what determinators so you can now move on and talk about.

278
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.400
calculating the

279
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.500
Eigenvalue, so let me create another file.

280
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.500
And call this eigen.

281
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.400
I'll use that.

282
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.700
Okay, so let me show you.

283
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.700
calculation of an eigen

284
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.600
the eigenvalues

285
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.100
if I type it it will be clear but more time consuming if I do

286
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.500
 it by hand, it will be faster, but

287
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.000
let's clear.

288
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.200
Let me do it. Let me do it by hand because it would

289
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.300
 be faster. Ross's example should be four.

290
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.100
example two

291
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:21.800
where

292
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.600
are you referring to this page?

293
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.800
this file

294
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.500
Oh, yes. Why did I get this wrong? It's

295
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.900
 supposed to yes, it's four times three.

296
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.200
This is what happens when you copy paste code. So this is

297
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:44.500
 a

298
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.700
four times three. Thank you.

299
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.100
Four times three, that's 12 minus 16.

300
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.400
And it is correctly of course times 3 is 12.

301
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.800
Minus 16 is negative 4. Yes. Thank you very much.

302
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:08.500
Okay.

303
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.700
Hope I didn't mess up any of these numbers.

304
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.600
Okay, eigenvalues now.

305
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.200
let me let me pull up my iPad because I

306
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.300
 think it will be faster because

307
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.200
quite some steps involved here.

308
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.600
so

309
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:45.500
maybe visit a dashboard

310
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.200
pick number

311
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:15.900
almost there.

312
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200
and then

313
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.200
go to the dashboard.

314
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.900
And click on the zoom link. Here we go.

315
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.000
All right.

316
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.500
change

317
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.200
waiting for Zoom to respond.

318
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.500
Just give me a second. Let me also get the pen.

319
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.800
Okay, here we go. Sorry for keeping you waiting.

320
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.200
Sure.

321
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.900
No, the iPad doesn't connect.

322
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.200
every single time

323
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.300
something has to happen.

324
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.100
and a few minutes has to be

325
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.200
we used it to these things one more time.

326
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.300
that the user in

327
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.800
and then just change this host.

328
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.100
Here we go.

329
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.600
finally share

330
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:18.700
screen

331
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.300
Here we go.

332
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:37.900
Okay.

333
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.600
you know there is a cable for this but

334
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.100
For some reason when I plug in the cable, it doesn't work.

335
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.800
 It keeps on disconnecting so I have to resort to using Zoom.

336
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.900
Oh one second. Let me see what I just.

337
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.000
Okay, here we go, finally.

338
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.400
So let's say we have a simple 2 by

339
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:48.900
 2 Matrix.

340
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.900
If you remember we talked about this form.

341
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:54.700
of a matrix

342
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.200
a x equals B

343
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.800
a x equals B

344
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.600
where AZ Matrix X is equal to a

345
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.700
 vector and B is a vectors if we multiply the matrix

346
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.400
 by the vector will get the B Vector now, this is also related to

347
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.400
 the inverse of a matrix which will come

348
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.100
 back to momentarily Okay, so

349
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.300
Let's say we have this Matrix.

350
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.900
Square Matrix with components 7

351
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.300
3

352
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.300
3 and negative 1

353
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.300
and we want to calculate the eigenvector for

354
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.100
the square Matrix

355
00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.600
so, this is our Matrix a

356
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.400
Well, we all do that. Well, we will next do then is we will take this Matrix in

357
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.000
 multiplied by the identity Matrix so we will go.

358
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.300
Or rather what we're going to do is we're going to take an identity

359
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.700
 Matrix and multiply it by the scalar

360
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.100
 Lambda.

361
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.800
So let's keep this as they

362
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:17.900
 give it.

363
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.300
Okay.

364
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.900
And then we have the idea in The Matrix, which we know is one.

365
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.800
zero zero one

366
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.200
it will then multiply this by Lambda.

367
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.500
if you remember from

368
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.100
the X the axioms of

369
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.400
vectors

370
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.300
we can multiply scalar by effect. We can also multiply scalars.

371
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.500
By what the Matrix and simply

372
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.600
 what this will do is we will substitute the ones with the

373
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.200
 lambdas.

374
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.900
So this will be a variation of the identity. Matrix

375
00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.800
 will have Lambda across the diagonal.

376
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.600
0 elsewhere

377
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.100
Okay.

378
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:11.900
with this

379
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.200
combination

380
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.100
we're going to subtract.

381
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.700
from the

382
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.300
original Matrix a

383
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.900
this Matrix that we have created and we will represent this Matrix as a

384
00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.200
 as a Lambda times.

385
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:31.500
 I

386
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.000
since I is used to represent the

387
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.000
identity Matrix we're going to represent this Matrix as

388
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.500
Lambda times I

389
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:45.500
so

390
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.800
next thing we are going to do.

391
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.200
is subtract from The Matrix a

392
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.600
Lambda

393
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.700
times I

394
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.100
in other words the difference of this Matrix.

395
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:10.500
and

396
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:12.900
the given Matrix

397
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:32.700
Okay.

398
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.200
This is that Matrix.

399
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.400
and this product

400
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.700
is that Matrix?

401
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.200
Okay.

402
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.000
The next thing we are going to do.

403
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.200
Is what the subtract these two is to do

404
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:50.800
 the following.

405
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.500
We're going to get a third Matrix.

406
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.800
We have seven. Let me zoom in.

407
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.300
We have seven minus Lambda.

408
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.800
minus 1

409
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.100
minus Lambda

410
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.200
and then of course the other numbers which are three and

411
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:14.800
three

412
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:18.700
Okay.

413
00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:22.800
and this

414
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.500
we will pass as argument to determine

415
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:28.900
 it function.

416
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.300
So we will take this Matrix.

417
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.200
And then we will take the determinant of this Matrix.

418
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.500
And we've already seen how we can take the determinant

419
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.300
 of a matrix it will be.

420
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.200
The product of these two numbers minus the

421
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.400
 product of these two numbers.

422
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.700
and then we will get

423
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.800
maybe just copy these.

424
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.800
down here

425
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:17.100
So what do we get?

426
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.400
We get these two.

427
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.200
minus

428
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.400
minus

429
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.000
3 by 3

430
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.900
now

431
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.300
if we multiply these numbers together.

432
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.900
We get the following.

433
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.100
expression

434
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.900
so this is the determinant of the above Matrix we

435
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.300
 will get

436
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.500
minus 7

437
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.400
minus 7

438
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.100
and then minus

439
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.800
6 times Lambda

440
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.800
plus Lambda squared

441
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.900
plus or rather minus 9

442
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.100
Okay, and then we solve we are.

443
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.000
You know do some algebra.

444
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.000
So adding the

445
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.900
minus seven to minus 9 we get

446
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.400
Negative 16, but we also have to make sure.

447
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.700
To bring the terms.

448
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.200
What?

449
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.200
The high order terms to the front. So Lambda squared must

450
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.000
 come here to the front.

451
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.800
And we have minus six Lambda.

452
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.400
And then we get minus 16.

453
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.500
Now here we have.

454
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.700
an unknown variable

455
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.100
that's the eigenvalue. So we

456
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.700
 need to find you have to solve for Lambda here.

457
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.600
Of course, we will Factor these two numbers.

458
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:02.800
to get

459
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.000
let me make some steps here. So this is

460
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.700
let's call this step one.

461
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:17.600
step one

462
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.600
subtracting

463
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.000
the subtracting a from Lambda times

464
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.200
 I

465
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:28.800
so

466
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.800
subtract

467
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.200
the Matrix a from

468
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.500
then the times I

469
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.300
then we have step two.

470
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.000
step two

471
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.800
solve for Lambda

472
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.200
so I'm going to copy this.

473
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.500
expression

474
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.100
We can.

475
00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.500
Factor these terms so we will get

476
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:15.700
Lambda

477
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.800
Lambda minus 8

478
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.000
and Lambda plus 2

479
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.600
of course is equal to zero.

480
00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.300
And then so we will get that way

481
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.100
 what we will have two equations not the minus 8

482
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.300
 Lambda plus 2 if we move them to the other side of the equation this would become

483
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.100
 Lambda equals 8.

484
00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.300
Lambda equals to so these are our two eigenvalues.

485
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.500
Plant asks, do you have to take the determinant?

486
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.400
first and step 2

487
00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.800
We took the determinant of your step 1.

488
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.400
Okay, that's a

489
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.000
 good point. So let's make this step 3.

490
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.800
Let's make this step three two, excuse

491
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.300
 me from my

492
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.700
Handwriting this is why why you use latex to avoid?

493
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.800
So having to correct myself continuously step two

494
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.200
 would be yeah step two would be

495
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.000
 the determinant.

496
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.100
Step 2

497
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:25.300
would be

498
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.400
determinant of that

499
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:32.900
question

500
00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.000
just bring this down here.

501
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.700
So determinant of

502
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.700
That right.

503
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.100
so

504
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.400
by the way, I will write this all down in latex. So you

505
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.400
 don't have to look at this. It's just faster to go to for

506
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.600
 me to have to do this by running.

507
00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.400
Now we can do is we can go back to the Lambda times

508
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.800
 I Matrix so this one up here.

509
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.500
and plug in

510
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.200
the roots so we can either use eight or

511
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.200
two

512
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.000
So here's what we will do next.

513
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.300
Actually, I meant to say this Matrix this one this one.

514
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.800
We're going to plug in the values for Lambda.

515
00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.600
Okay, as a matter of fact, let me copy this. I'm

516
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.300
 just going to copy this thing.

517
00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.200
So we step four.

518
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.700
Let's bring this down here.

519
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.700
here

520
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:50.000
I have to drag it all the way down here. Just

521
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:51.700
there we go.

522
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.200
So first step four we have these two roots.

523
00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.800
We can use either one of them. Let's do.

524
00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.000
Let's do it first.

525
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.700
Although the solution book for well, we'll work for either one. Both of

526
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.700
 those will give you your eigenvector.

527
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.300
so the step four

528
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.000
plug-in values

529
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.600
or

530
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.200
Lambda

531
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.400
in the determinant of the

532
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.300
function so in

533
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.500
okay, this will give us a matrix. We're going to take one

534
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.100
 of those roots and plug it into this Matrix.

535
00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.500
Well, no the determinant of a matrix doesn't give us a matrix it

536
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.600
 give us a it gives us a determinant which

537
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.300
 is a scalar value.

538
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.500
What I should have done is remove the determines.

539
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.300
 Yes be very careful with what I say.

540
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:16.500
So

541
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.000
let's just bring this over here.

542
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.200
now the determinant the difference

543
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.300
of a

544
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:27.600
and

545
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.400
Lambda terms are times. I

546
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.300
that's this Matrix. This is that Matrix.

547
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.200
 So we will take one of those numbers.

548
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.800
8 and plug in for these values

549
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.000
So we're gonna I'm gonna copy this.

550
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.800
And to replace the lambdas with 8.

551
00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:51.700
with 8

552
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.100
and then we simplify this. Yes, so we have negative 1

553
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.500
we have negative 1 we have three.

554
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:02.800
three

555
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.300
this is three and this is negative 9.

556
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.000
so

557
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.500
At what do we do next we?

558
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:24.800
we represent this as a

559
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.500
system of equations

560
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.000
so we can find x sub 1 and x sub 2

561
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.400
where x sub 1 and x sub 2 are the values in

562
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.200
 the eigenvector.

563
00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:46.900
So step 5.

564
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.800
Now that we found the eigenvalues we can solve or we

565
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.800
 can find the eigenvector.

566
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.400
find

567
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:02.600
the

568
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.900
eigenvectors

569
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.500
eigenvector

570
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.300
single we have the argument values

571
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.300
 we can now find the eigenvector.

572
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.800
So to do this we are going to create an

573
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.300
 augmented Matrix. So I'm going to take this Matrix.

574
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.000
Don't take this.

575
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.400
Copy it.

576
00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:27.600
down here

577
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.900
and we are going to have a square Matrix. Excuse

578
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.800
 me. We're gonna have a vector.

579
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:47.900
0

580
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.100
essentially what this?

581
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.800
Equation represents is the following.

582
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:53.900
we have

583
00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.800
we want to solve we want to find the eigenvector. So

584
00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.300
 basically

585
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:03.800
the vector

586
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.700
That when we multiply by this Matrix.

587
00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:09.200
gives us

588
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.100
that vector

589
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.300
and so the values of this Vector are unknown and

590
00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.100
 we will say x sub 1 and x sub 2

591
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.800
x sub 1 x sub 2

592
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.300
so we have minus 1 x sub

593
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:28.500
 1

594
00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.000
Plus

595
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.200
3 x sub 2

596
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.000
equals 0

597
00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.400
and we have in the second equation 3.

598
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:40.900
3

599
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.500
x sub 1 plus negative 9 x

600
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.700
 up to equal 0

601
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.100
and like we saw in the linear program example, we need

602
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:51.400
 to solve.

603
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.500
these equations or at least

604
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.400
as you know

605
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.400
eliminally one of them

606
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.400
Eliminate one of them. Let me show you what elimination means

607
00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.800
so I'm going to once again.

608
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.800
We're going to augment the above Matrix.

609
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.100
If you remember what we said about augmenting matrices, so let

610
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.000
 me just copy you not gonna be copy the whole thing.

611
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.600
I'm gonna copy the whole thing.

612
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:22.800
It's down here.

613
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.900
When you augment a matrix.

614
00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.500
What you do is you you bring these two matrices together and then you separate

615
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.400
 them by some vertical line.

616
00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.400
This vertical line means there's an equation.

617
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.700
So everything to the right side is an equation everything the

618
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.500
 left side are well.

619
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.500
the variables

620
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.300
these are your variables.

621
00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:58.700
and these are the

622
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.200
the zeros of your equation

623
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.200
What we will then do is use.

624
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.600
Get the gaussian elimination to find the

625
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.000
 X's.

626
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.200
so

627
00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.900
I'm going to for the time being remove

628
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:26.200
 this.

629
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.400
Augmented the augmented part because they're

630
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.000
 all equal to zero.

631
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.300
and

632
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.200
but this looks like it's

633
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.700
Parallel, isn't it?

634
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.100
because if you

635
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:45.400
Multiply the first one by a negative number you're going to get 1 minus

636
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.100
 3 which is and multiplied by 3. You're going to get the same

637
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:48.800
 as the button.

638
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.700
So X1 and X2 is going to be 0.

639
00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.200
So I don't think I understood repeat your question, please.

640
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:03.800
up here

641
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.800
or you think they won't be long, right?

642
00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.500
You multiply the first one by negative 3 then

643
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.200
 you're gonna get 3x1.

644
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.200
Minus 9 x 2 equals 0 which is the same as the bottom

645
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:16.500
 one.

646
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.900
Yeah, so basically we want to eliminate this

647
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.100
 rule so we will exactly what you said

648
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.100
So in order for us to eliminate this

649
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.500
 row.

650
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.300
because once we eliminate the first row the second row

651
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.900
 then we have found then we can solve for

652
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.300
at least just for just one equation. So to do

653
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.100
 this we're going to

654
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.500
take

655
00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.500
Row one multiplied by three just like you said,

656
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.200
 so three times R1

657
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.600
and add that to

658
00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.800
Row 2

659
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.000
and the result of this we will override or we will

660
00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.500
put inside or two.

661
00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.500
Okay. So what we

662
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.200
 are doing is this

663
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.200
this operation

664
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.100
multiply

665
00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.500
3 times negative 1 so multiply 3

666
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.100
 3 will apply to all the terms.

667
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.100
and this equation

668
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.300
so and we actually remove the augmented Matrix so

669
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.800
 we don't need to worry about this anymore.

670
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.800
This will become negative 3.

671
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.800
negative 3

672
00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.100
this will become positive 9.

673
00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:47.600
Add these two.

674
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.700
Well, I can't call them equations anymore. Let me bring back to 0 so their equations

675
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.200
 now, they're equations if we add these terms together.

676
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.400
What do we get we get well.

677
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.900
Well, everything becomes a zero.

678
00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:10.200
So the result of this.

679
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:11.700
Edition

680
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.300
this will become this will become the second row.

681
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.200
the second row

682
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.900
in other words after we perform this calcium

683
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.800
 this what we're very simple gaussian

684
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.100
 step.

685
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.400
calculate elimination step

686
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.800
this Matrix

687
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.000
will become

688
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:36.800
that Matrix

689
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.100
these becomes zeros.

690
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.300
Now we can plug in these values into the equation.

691
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.300
So remember we have x sub 1

692
00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:51.900
and x sub 2

693
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.700
and we want to know what these are.

694
00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.000
So to do that.

695
00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.100
We're going to say negative 1.

696
00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.100
X Plus

697
00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.500
3 x squared

698
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.800
and these are the values now.

699
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.200
These are the values of x sub 1 x of it because if we

700
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.900
 multiply this Matrix will put that vector.

701
00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.900
We will get these numbers.

702
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.600
So these are now the components of the eigenvector. So now

703
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.600
 the eigenvector is

704
00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.600
well, it's it's the it's here minus one and three.

705
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.900
So if you go all the way back up.

706
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.600
if we go all the way back up to

707
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.900
The Matrix up here

708
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.400
Where did I put it?

709
00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.300
Yeah this one.

710
00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.700
So if you want to find the b

711
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.600
 or we're going to do is we're going to multiply the matrix

712
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.000
 by the eigenvector that we just found.

713
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.100
And you will find what B is so.

714
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.800
I'm going to copy this.

715
00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.900
But I don't want to go all the way down. So I'm just going to

716
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.700
copy it up here.

717
00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.000
so this is a

718
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.600
X we just found that was equal to

719
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.000
negative 1 and 3, correct?

720
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.900
on my notes, it says 1

721
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.000
What did I do wrong again?

722
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.000
So

723
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.600
I missed a step here.

724
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.100
and

725
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.300
alright

726
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.000
I need to move the

727
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.200
yeah, I need to solve for the I need to solve for these.

728
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.700
 That's this is incorrect. So before I can do that.

729
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.300
I need to set this to zero and then solve for x sub

730
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:52.500
 1.

731
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.400
And x sub 2 so minus

732
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.700
 one X will become.

733
00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:04.000
or rather what I can do is I can

734
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.200
swap these I can have three x sub

735
00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.400
 2

736
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.100
and then subtract

737
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:15.500
minus

738
00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.000
1X to bring this to the

739
00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:20.500
 other side

740
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.100
So we will have One X.

741
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.300
And we just to simplified the notation. That's

742
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.500
 just and sorry. This will be positive One X.

743
00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.400
positive 1X

744
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.100
and if we just lose the one because we don't

745
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:45.300
 put the constant there when it's 1 then X is

746
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:45.600
 just equal to

747
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.600
X is just equal to 3 times x

748
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.000
 sub 2

749
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:54.900
That's except one.

750
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.200
and

751
00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.200
well x sub 2

752
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:01.600
so here we have.

753
00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:03.800
our vector

754
00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:08.900
x sub 1 is equal to 3.

755
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:11.800
Right if we swap the orders.

756
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.700
we'll get three X2 and if

757
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.600
 we solve for x sub 2

758
00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:18.400
then

759
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.700
we'll have x sub 2 equals.

760
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:24.800
except

761
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.500
And lose the three.

762
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.700
What do we do?

763
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.300
Yeah, we just divide both sides by 3.

764
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.200
So this will become one.

765
00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:52.400
Anyway, this is this is the this is the correct eigenvector.

766
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.500
Come back up here.

767
00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.500
We will have three.

768
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.700
so x sub 1

769
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.200
x sub 2

770
00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.000
now, of course we need to

771
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.400
Do the Matrix times do the vector

772
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.100
 Matrix Vector multiplication in one

773
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.100
 sense? Rhs right hand side is zero. We can

774
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:22.800
 always divide by 3 and get back to the original.

775
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.600
Yes now to so this

776
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.100
 is now a we have found the eigen we have

777
00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.700
 found the components for the eigenvector.

778
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:31.900
now

779
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.400
To be now. We need to multiply this so we will multiply these and

780
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:37.700
 we will get

781
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:39.900
maybe do this very quickly.

782
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.000
So this will be seven.

783
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:53.400
Times three and three times one anyway, skipping

784
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.900
 skipping the most the

785
00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.000
 product and some business. We will get this.

786
00:50:59.200 --> 00:50:59.600
third vector

787
00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.600
which is equal to 24.

788
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:06.600
and date

789
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.400
And what's interesting is that we can Factor.

790
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.300
The scalar eight from this Matrix. So this is now B.

791
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.400
So another way to represent this vector.

792
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.700
is to represent it like so

793
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:28.000
is to go 8 the scalar multiplied by

794
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.200
3

795
00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.100
times 1

796
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.500
and it turns out this is one of the this was one of the values for

797
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.400
 the eigenvalue.

798
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.900
So if you multiply this 8 by 3, we will get 24.

799
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.000
multiply 8 times 1 obviously will get 8

800
00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:46.700
All right.

801
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.000
This is how you calculate.

802
00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:59.100
The eigenvalues and I how you find

803
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.800
 argument that is not eigenvector 402 by 2.

804
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:03.800
very

805
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.200
I don't want to say tedious but you know, you have

806
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.300
 to first do the difference find the difference.

807
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:15.600
of the

808
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.000
identity Matrix that is multiplied by Lambda.

809
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.600
Then you will get a third Matrix.

810
00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.100
So then you have to take the determinant of that Matrix.

811
00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.100
Once you take the term of that Matrix you will that's you will

812
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:33.400
 get this.

813
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.200
expression

814
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.300
and then you have to solve for laptop and you will get two values

815
00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.100
 two eigenvalues.

816
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.300
So run ask what are eigenvectors good for?

817
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.600
They are a way to encode.

818
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.900
values in square matrices

819
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.200
So in statistics, we have something called.

820
00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.400
variance

821
00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.800
From which we can get standard deviation?

822
00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.400
Then there's a matrix called The Core variance Matrix.

823
00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.600
From which we can get the correlation Matrix and the correlation Matrix.

824
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.300
will encode the correlation of multiple factors, for

825
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:15.500
 example

826
00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:19.700
Let's say you want to see.

827
00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:22.900
What?

828
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.300
factors influence the

829
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.700
salary a person gets

830
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.200
let me actually pull up a picture from Google Images.

831
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.200
 I'm gonna have to stop sharing.

832
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.900
Let me stop sharing.

833
00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.600
Make myself host here.

834
00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.400
And share the screen.

835
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:07.700
Okay.

836
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.300
correlation

837
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.100
Matrix

838
00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.700
Let's see what they have written here on the sides even Capital. It's

839
00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.600
 something something more.

840
00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.000
basic

841
00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.200
Okay, these are not as correlated as much something that is hiding.

842
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.100
 I want to basic example, so you get the point.

843
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.900
Yeah, this could work I suppose.

844
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.700
This is a correlation Matrix.

845
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.300
so eigenvectors alone

846
00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.000
may they're not.

847
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.000
Maybe they don't have

848
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.900
interesting applications, but they will

849
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.000
 get us to something like

850
00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:36.200
SVD or PCA

851
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.300
Let me first show you the correlation Matrix, okay?

852
00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.700
Now, of course the Matrix here, this is colored.

853
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.400
But the actual correlation Matrix that you look at.

854
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:52.400
is

855
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.100
Just a matrix of numbers.

856
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.300
Now, why do we see this full red color in here that

857
00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.000
 because that's because and by the way, this is this has to do

858
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.200
 with data relating to different cars MPG

859
00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:08.300
 stands for miles per gallon miles per

860
00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:11.100
 gallon the number of cylinders displacement.

861
00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.200
I remember what that refers to but the horsepower of the car the weight

862
00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:15.400
 of the car.

863
00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.900
And the acceleration the car correlation in statistics

864
00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:23.000
 is a number that goes from negative 1 to positive one where

865
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.900
 positive one is a very strong positive

866
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:29.100
 correlation negative 1 is a strong inverse correlation.

867
00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:31.200
 So as the more of this you have

868
00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.200
 the less of the other you have.

869
00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:36.400
And the correlation of zero or something that is close to zero means that these

870
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.000
 two these two things are not.

871
00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.700
really correlated

872
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.200
So, of course if we start here at the top component of

873
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.800
 this Matrix now you're trying to imagine this is an actual Matrix.

874
00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:46.900
Okay.

875
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.100
Miles per gallon of miles per gallon obviously since the

876
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.300
 same.

877
00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.300
Feature or same factor, they will have 100% correlation.

878
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.400
But but then we can compare miles per gallon.

879
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.000
and the cylinders

880
00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:06.900
you can see the cylinders are negatively strongly correlated

881
00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.400
 with Mossberg than I see strongly because it's almost 0.8.

882
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.100
It is also negatively.

883
00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.000
And strongly correlated with displacement and horsepower and

884
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.500
 wait.

885
00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.300
Let's solid acceleration.

886
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.600
So basically this Matrix is some sort of.

887
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.600
Contains information. It's some sort of encoding.

888
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.200
You can use this to look up to very quickly

889
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.100
 establish the like I said the strength of

890
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:39.600
 correlation.

891
00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.500
Now, let me if I let me see if I if I can

892
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:44.800
 type in.

893
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.500
I have a I have an example from a book PCA.

894
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.700
correlation

895
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:56.400
Matrix

896
00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.100
and stock prices

897
00:57:59.000 --> 00:57:59.300
again

898
00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:04.200
We think they predicting stock prices not something you can actually do.

899
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.400
Okay, but again, I'll use that

900
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:07.700
 an example.

901
00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:11.300
And the reason I say stock prices again, I'm not an

902
00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:12.200
 investor but every book.

903
00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.700
I've come across is that you really can't predict stock prices?

904
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:20.000
And if you're investor you're but your best artist to invest

905
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:20.700
 in indices.

906
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.400
Which is like a mixed bag of stocks anyway.

907
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.200
Never mind, whether stock prices are something

908
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.200
 you can predict or not. Let me just show you.

909
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.400
A practical application not of eigenvectors.

910
00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:36.500
but

911
00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:38.200
SVD

912
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:42.000
And PCA which require the calculation of

913
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:42.600
 eigenvectors.

914
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.200
I don't think I'll be able to find it here or is this

915
00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:58.300
 the one?

916
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:03.100
Let me show you PCA. Let me show you PCA PCA and

917
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.900
 dimensionality reduction.

918
00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:06.600
so

919
00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:13.600
this could work.

920
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:16.600
Let's open this keep this here.

921
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:17.900
and

922
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.400
Maybe this one as well. Let me try another one.

923
00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:28.600
3D

924
00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:38.100
you

925
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:48.300
don't even

926
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.700
Yes, my understanding of eigenvectors. Basically.

927
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.400
 It's a linear transformation of

928
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.600
 a vector into an orthogonal space that is

929
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.700
 easier to understand and work with so so even

930
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.700
 with PCA what like PCA component

931
01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.800
 one and PCA component two orthogonal to

932
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.400
 each other so when you know in which

933
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:10.700
 direction

934
01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:12.200
or the

935
01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.800
The relationship of the data how it's moving.

936
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.500
Yeah, but we haven't talked about orthogonal matrices. So I'm just trying to look for some visual.

937
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.200
 That's very.

938
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.000
I think this isn't good enough.

939
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.700
Okay, so let me open this here. Let's use this.

940
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.200
Yeah, we haven't covered all the types of matrices so which is why I said, you know

941
01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.500
 like I dedicated entire module for PCA.

942
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.700
And let me also type in correlation here.

943
01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:38.800
Just correlation.

944
01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.200
Okay, just a little bit of Statistics here correlation.

945
01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.100
Is something you can both compute?

946
01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:47.100
with

947
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.000
basic arithmetic

948
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.500
and it is something that is very visually simple to

949
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.900
See, for example, let's look at this picture over here.

950
01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:58.100
Okay.

951
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.000
Again, this is a these are

952
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.400
 Green Dots. We call observations. So for example

953
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:06.900
and

954
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:12.400
again, let's consider two factors. The x-axis is

955
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:12.500
 a

956
01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.700
The years of education you have and the

957
01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:21.900
 y-axis is your salary.

958
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.200
Let's just let's just say hypothetically these two things are

959
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.800
 very strongly correlated. In fact, they have 100% correlation.

960
01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.100
 So salary is

961
01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.100
Purely a function of how much?

962
01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.100
How many years you've spent in college not the case and really the real world but

963
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.600
 let's say no hypothetical World which is why we get this.

964
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.300
Which is why you know every observation here.

965
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.700
false

966
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.000
on this vertical line

967
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.500
And so even if we want to remove this line, you

968
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.600
 could see a clear pattern.

969
01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.600
More salary, excuse me, more experience most more education

970
01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.200
 more salary.

971
01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.100
Then here we have inverse relationship. So the more of something you have

972
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.200
 the less of the the other for example.

973
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.500
X-axis could be the number of hours you spend on social

974
01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:11.700
 media.

975
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.700
And why access could be?

976
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.000
your level of happiness

977
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.200
I think we can all agree that is true to some extent right? So the

978
01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.500
 more time you spent on social media.

979
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:30.000
The less happy you become.

980
01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.900
I know that is true for me. I

981
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.700
use social media for news

982
01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.200
and nothing could ever comes out of it, but I still do it

983
01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.900
 anyway, but these two factors are negatively correlated.

984
01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.400
I get but again it consists call it because you have this pattern now

985
01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.500
 in reality. You will never get this perfectly. You will

986
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.400
 never have all of these observations for nicely on

987
01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.100
 this straight line. They will be somewhere around it.

988
01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.000
And then but these are extreme examples just to make a point.

989
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.300
And of course we have something that's on code when something on color

990
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.800
 you don't there is no clear pattern.

991
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.600
Like is it going up? Is it going down everything is scattered around?

992
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.700
Okay, and we say this you have a lot of residuals. So residuals are

993
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.400
 the distance between observations from this line.

994
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.400
 So this on correctly.

995
01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.300
Now this is a two-dimensional.

996
01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.700
data point or two dimensional

997
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.000
comparison. We're comparing two factors.

998
01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.900
In reality, you're going to have a lot of features consider

999
01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.400
 this example where we have three features.

1000
01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.800
Right, so we have three axes and maybe you

1001
01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.000
 can see a pattern. Maybe you can see a plane.

1002
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:44.400
go from like this point and then just

1003
01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.500
goes higher up

1004
01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.200
But there are situations where we

1005
01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:50.300
 have.

1006
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.500
For the for the for the four features or four

1007
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.600
 factors in statistics. We say factors and Machinery

1008
01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.100
 we say features.

1009
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.000
We will use this word in module 4 but let's say you have

1010
01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.600
 four dimensions five Dimensions 10 Dimensions. So 10 factors.

1011
01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:06.500
and

1012
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.100
you do not know.

1013
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.100
the

1014
01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.400
validity of the correlation

1015
01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.700
Let me Give an example, let's say we are talking about shoe sizes

1016
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.600
Imagine you have a data set.

1017
01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:26.900
Let me come to vs code.

1018
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.800
And our data set is a CSV file.

1019
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.300
A CSF or imagine an Excel sheet with the following

1020
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:38.700
 columns.

1021
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.900
Okay. I'm going to come back to PC and I get vectors.

1022
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.500
In a second, so we have what are

1023
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.100
 the shoes that what are different ways shoe sizes are labeled.

1024
01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.500
 There's the US shoe size.

1025
01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.800
There is the UK shoe size. There's a European shoe

1026
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:54.900
 size.

1027
01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.400
There is the Japanese shoe size.

1028
01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.500
And then there's centimeter.

1029
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.600
Okay, which is the most precise?

1030
01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.500
form of measuring

1031
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.800
Now, of course all four of all five factors, here are strongly

1032
01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.200
 correlated the if you have a large shoe

1033
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.200
 size.

1034
01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.500
in the US column

1035
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.500
or you will have a larger shoe size the UK column. I mean

1036
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.000
 that's obvious, right?

1037
01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.300
If you have a bigger if you if you have a larger shoe size,

1038
01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:28.600
 it will be larger across the board.

1039
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.000
Okay, and this is quite this is

1040
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.200
 common sense. We don't need anything special but what if

1041
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.400
 we come across the data set that looks like this.

1042
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.000
And these will be very strongly correlated. So this will be

1043
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.500
 one one.

1044
01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:47.500
Okay.

1045
01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:52.700
But let's consider an example where something is

1046
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.000
 not very clear. You will come across data sets with

1047
01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.200
 the car that features are not meaningful.

1048
01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.000
now, let's say we have

1049
01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:06.100
I don't know. I'm not a biologist, but let's say different.

1050
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.200
protein so we have P sub 1

1051
01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:09.700
piece up to

1052
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:13.700
piece of 3

1053
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.000
p sub 4

1054
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:20.400
Okay.

1055
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.100
different types of proteins

1056
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.600
What are they be there is leucine.

1057
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.100
What are different types of the different, you know, the different

1058
01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.400
 types of proteins we have?

1059
01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.200
RDL Arginine and the others okay, but even

1060
01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.800
 in data said they may not be properly named.

1061
01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.700
Moreover you might not always have a domain expert you

1062
01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.900
 see in situations like this.

1063
01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.900
Or this example here where we had, you know.

1064
01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:57.200
miles per cylinder

1065
01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.300
miles per gallon. Okay. If you

1066
01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.200
 do not know what a displacement is and how it's related to

1067
01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.500
 miles per gallon. You can always consult someone.

1068
01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.700
Like mechanic or an automotive engineer and

1069
01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.200
 they will explain to you. Why why it's the

1070
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.000
 case that these two are.

1071
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.100
Strongly correlated to each other but you will

1072
01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.900
 not always have something like you might have something like this what it is not popularly.

1073
01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.200
And you still want to perform machine learning on this data set

1074
01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.900
 now in the above example here.

1075
01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.900
How many dimensions do we have? We have five dimensions?

1076
01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:26.800
Okay.

1077
01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.800
This is on. This is an unnecessarily High

1078
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.400
 dimensional data.

1079
01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:39.100
It will make it difficult more for the machine learning model to learn

1080
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.500
 what we call the hyperparameters of our

1081
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:41.700
 features.

1082
01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.900
long story short if I can really simplify this PC

1083
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.500
 will allow us to

1084
01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:52.800
collapse the dimensions go from five Dimensions

1085
01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.900
 to three dimensions to do dimensions.

1086
01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:58.300
So for example, we can just have and you

1087
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:02.400
 know what let's add a sixth column here. And let's call this height, right? It

1088
01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.800
 is the case that taller people.

1089
01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:05.100
have

1090
01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.300
larger shoe sizes

1091
01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:12.000
and let's say it's a very strongly correlated.

1092
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.800
Okay, 95% correlation.

1093
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.500
We can reduce the dimensionality so we can go from these six columns

1094
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.300
 to two columns what you will call.

1095
01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.300
pc1 and PC2 principle component

1096
01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.500
 1 and principle component two

1097
01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.000
Again, this is the stuff. I left for the Friday session.

1098
01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.400
But it allow us to collapse our data and

1099
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.600
 only retain relevant information.

1100
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.100
This is especially you know, in in this data set

1101
01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.200
 we could have just stuck with one of these units of right we could have just used

1102
01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:49.700
 one of these sizes because you know, what forget about the Internationals

1103
01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.500
 the other shoe size. This is you sent a meter.

1104
01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.000
This is the most accurate.

1105
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.100
measurement

1106
01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.600
and we don't need to do anything complicated but in

1107
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.800
 a situation like this we do.

1108
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.400
We we do not know how they are correlated and to what

1109
01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:05.700
 extent.

1110
01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:08.800
And we do not want to keep five dimensions.

1111
01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.900
Because it could be more than five. It could be 20 Dimensions 50 Dimensions. It

1112
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:13.700
 is not something we can.

1113
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:15.400
manage

1114
01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.500
or want to manage at least

1115
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.800
so what we will do is we will use the technique of PCA to

1116
01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.700
collapse this I will use that would collapse to

1117
01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:25.900
 get PC one PC.

1118
01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:27.700
PC2

1119
01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.900
so this is what we mean by dimensionality reduction.

1120
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.900
pc1 will encode pc1 and

1121
01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.000
 PC2 would encode

1122
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.500
the variance

1123
01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.200
amongst these data

1124
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:46.600
and another for us to calculate in order for us to perform PCA we

1125
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.300
 need well, I can calculating the eigenvalues is

1126
01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.300
 one step to getting that point. But

1127
01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.100
 again, these are the steps you have to perform completely.

1128
01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:59.300
The calculate the eigenvalues you need to determine it to calculate the calculator.

1129
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.600
 Now we need eigen eigenvalues to

1130
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.000
 calculate again everything.

1131
01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:09.400
All the layers below all the subsequent layers below

1132
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:10.800
 are prerequisite. So this

1133
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.300
has prerequisite that this intern has

1134
01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:17.500
 prerequisite that this internet has prerequisite that so

1135
01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.100
what I'm trying to do is mmm cover these

1136
01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.400
 prerequisite so we can jump into practical applications of SVD and

1137
01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:24.800
 PCA.

1138
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.500
So these alone?

1139
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.700
I can't come up with any interesting examples.

1140
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.700
in of applications

1141
01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.700
But these are definitely interesting.

1142
01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.900
Now maybe that's not a satisfying answer and I know it's not.

1143
01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.800
I actually look for different examples of applications of

1144
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.800
 eigenvalues.

1145
01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.700
but the olds in one way or another point to

1146
01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.100
ultimately to these to these techniques up here.

1147
01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.700
Okay. Now I'm going to clean up the note for

1148
01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.200
 the the whole iPad stuff for

1149
01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:02.900
 eigenvalues.

1150
01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:06.600
But I hope at least you you see what

1151
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:09.200
 the at least you can determine what the determin it is if I

1152
01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:09.500
 come back here.

1153
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:12.900
Pull this up.

1154
01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.700
The key thing is the determinant.

1155
01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.300
and the rest of it was just

1156
01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.700
basic algebra

1157
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.000
and

1158
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.400
scalar multiplication Matrix difference a differences

1159
01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:33.200
Okay.

1160
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.300
Any question or comments before I move on to the next topic? Let me

1161
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.000
 check the chats. There's anyone say anything else.

1162
01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.600
okay, there's

1163
01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.300
two comments

1164
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.800
Is a simple definition for PCA replace

1165
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.600
 data in a specific Dimension with a function?

1166
01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.900
not quite

1167
01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.300
because we're not replacing the data we are.

1168
01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.300
encoding the data

1169
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.800
in a smaller dimension

1170
01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.100
And from our example for today, can we graph the

1171
01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.200
 input of the two by two Matrix and then it's eigenvector?

1172
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.300
How do you mean graph it?

1173
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.700
So if I go back to the and send the iPad but this

1174
01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:31.800
 is the original Matrix.

1175
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.700
This is the original Matrix.

1176
01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.700
And we copy the step. It's here.

1177
01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.900
The original Matrix was this.

1178
01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.500
Seven three and three one.

1179
01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:13.800
but

1180
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.700
what is the what is your what is your

1181
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.800
motivation for wanting to visualize it

1182
01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.000
No, not necessarily this could be.

1183
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.800
Let me this Matrix is not particularly special. That's the problem.

1184
01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.000
This Matrix. Okay, so you let me see

1185
01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.700
 if I can find your practical example.

1186
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.300
Let's see if I can show you something.

1187
01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.200
Let me Google something for

1188
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.200
 you. I can factors.

1189
01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:58.800
or

1190
01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:21.000
hmm. Let me do this PCA correlation

1191
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.400
 Matrix.

1192
01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.200
principle

1193
01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.300
components

1194
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.200
the example for my book is quite helpful.

1195
01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.100
Not sure if I can find something online.

1196
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.200
Let's see this example over here.

1197
01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:31.500
something

1198
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.500
With a picture on it.

1199
01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.700
Yeah, this is this is something like that something like

1200
01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.200
 this. Now. What is the original table?

1201
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.300
Do they have an original table? I this has

1202
01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.100
 to do with a stock prices. I'm sure.

1203
01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.000
and where is the

1204
01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.600
yeah, this tattoo has to with stock prices.

1205
01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:59.200
If only I could find a table. I think this is a chapter

1206
01:15:59.200 --> 01:15:59.800
 of a book.

1207
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.700
but let's say let's say

1208
01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:17.700
you

1209
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:21.100
You have you have a scenario like this?

1210
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.100
You have a portfolio of stocks.

1211
01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:28.500
and

1212
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:34.200
if one stock price increases

1213
01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.500
the stock price

1214
01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.700
of the price of another stock also increases

1215
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:42.000
 so let's say for example

1216
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.400
We have a portfolio of 100 stocks.

1217
01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:47.900
and

1218
01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:52.300
Let's and I know new one you're more

1219
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:55.300
 into Finance. So it give me an example of one stock

1220
01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:55.800
 that would increase.

1221
01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:00.200
The stock price of well, the price of one stock they would increase with

1222
01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.100
 the price of another stock.

1223
01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.500
for example now

1224
01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.100
the price of

1225
01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:06.600
wheat

1226
01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.800
I think is that wheat as a commodity is higher. I

1227
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.400
 want the stock price of wheat goes up.

1228
01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:16.300
Anything that has to do with that particular commodity was also all

1229
01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:20.800
 feel feel like oh petroleum. Yeah,

1230
01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.200
 so when the price

1231
01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.200
 of controlling increases

1232
01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:27.800
The price of what other what other commodity

1233
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.000
 increases the price of

1234
01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.400
 bread increases for the price of bread increases because the price of

1235
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.100
 shipping increases the price of shipping will have the

1236
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:38.300
 factored into the purchase. And so when the price of oil

1237
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.200
 goes up so does the price of bread

1238
01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:41.600
but then

1239
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.800
companies will have this

1240
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.800
 this the cost of petroleum will

1241
01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.600
You know mmm.

1242
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.500
The expense this increased expense will navigate is

1243
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.700
 exactly exactly run. I mean, I don't need to say this you hear

1244
01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:01.500
 this all the everyday in the news. The price of crude goes up rent goes

1245
01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.500
 up electricity goes up food goes

1246
01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:04.600
 up.

1247
01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.700
buying anything from the supermarket goes up, right so

1248
01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:12.800
let's say

1249
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.300
that you have now crude is pretty

1250
01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:16.500
 clear.

1251
01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.100
But let's say you have

1252
01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.000
stock stocks or any type of

1253
01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.100
 commodity who's correlation is not clear at

1254
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.600
 least not to

1255
01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.000
one

1256
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.400
Financial analyst like it. It's gonna take more than just

1257
01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.500
 a few or a handful of experts to determine

1258
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.000
 the correlation.

1259
01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.400
There are too many factors involved. There's too many things that establish the Coalition

1260
01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.200
 of two stock prices.

1261
01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.700
So when you apply PCA, you

1262
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:50.300
 can't contain you can encode the

1263
01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:50.700
 correlation.

1264
01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:52.800
inside

1265
01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:56.600
these vectors we call the principal components.

1266
01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.500
So what I'm trying to say is this

1267
01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:03.700
You can.

1268
01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.500
Reduce the dimensionality of your

1269
01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:15.400
 data set. So again, we said we have 100 different stock

1270
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.700
 prices.

1271
01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.800
So you can collapse it into one two

1272
01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.900
 or three principal components.

1273
01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:23.600
and

1274
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.100
those principal components will then allow you

1275
01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:29.600
 to make.

1276
01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.800
the appropriate investment

1277
01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:35.900
again

1278
01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.300
It's very difficult for me to like.

1279
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.600
Demonstrate a PC without having covered the prerequisites. I did

1280
01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.600
 see a nice picture here just a while ago.

1281
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.100
PCA

1282
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.500
in I think was PC in a nutshell.

1283
01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.400
so generally in like a modern portfolio Theory what

1284
01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.000
 it says is

1285
01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:00.900
You want to invest your creative portfolio

1286
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.500
 in a way that?

1287
01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.600
You put your money or distributed in

1288
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.800
 opposingly varying.

1289
01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.600
assets or stocks

1290
01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:15.200
So that way one stock is going up then the other

1291
01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.300
 one is going down. And if the other one is going down there, so the

1292
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.200
 one is going up. So basically the variants are

1293
01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.800
 opposing. So therefore there are negatively correlated

1294
01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:25.900
 so that way you're

1295
01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:29.400
Average return at the end is going to be still.

1296
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:30.500
Good.

1297
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.500
Precisely because you always making money.

1298
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.700
You always gonna make money.

1299
01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:38.100
Because we have like this sea star situation.

1300
01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:39.500
but

1301
01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.200
yeah, so just like we want to point it out.

1302
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.900
We want to find out.

1303
01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.500
opposing variance

1304
01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.500
and to do that we have to go through this series of calculations

1305
01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.100
 to get to where we want. So this is where we want to end up.

1306
01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.200
and our starting point

1307
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.200
at least in linear algebra is

1308
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.700
this is missing some steps.

1309
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:17.400
But the steps that we will cover.

1310
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.200
In our next Workshop include we've already done

1311
01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.300
 eigenvectors. I'm gonna clean up the note, but we did Cover eigenvalues and

1312
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:24.700
 eigenvectors.

1313
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.100
and if you see here it says

1314
01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:32.800
Pick the eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues.

1315
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:36.400
Because those we can then use

1316
01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:40.000
 to find out on correlated uncorrelated data.

1317
01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.300
Which we can use to optimize our portfolio.

1318
01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.000
So now we've learned how to do this.

1319
01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:47.800
We've learned how to extract.

1320
01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:52.300
eigenvalues and calculate eigenvectors from

1321
01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.600
 it's from a square Matrix now, of course in

1322
01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:57.300
When it comes to something like a portfolio.

1323
01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.500
Optimization or what have you the square? Matrix

1324
01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.200
 would be a lot larger. You'll have a large data. But as

1325
01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.500
 long as Square makes you we can always calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

1326
01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.100
This is missing some stuff. So I'm not gonna use this many longer for reference.

1327
01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:17.400
but

1328
01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:27.500
yeah, I think we can cover these two, you know in our

1329
01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:27.700
 next session.

1330
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.400
And I will give you a practical example of SVD.

1331
01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.400
So we will of course on Friday talk about PC for

1332
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.700
 these two.

1333
01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.700
But tomorrow but excuse me on Wednesday, I'll give you a practical

1334
01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:43.400
 application of SPD, but we need to First cover this part at

1335
01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:43.400
 least.

1336
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.400
Okay that a normalization.

1337
01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.000
Okay, we have seven minutes left. Let me

1338
01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.500
 see how we can use this time wisely.

1339
01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.000
Let me show you the code. I think I can at least

1340
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.500
 show you part of the characteristic polynomial.

1341
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:08.900
Here we go.

1342
01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.200
I have it here.

1343
01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:39.100
Rona scores the eigenvector. Yeah, so let me come here. Let me

1344
01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:39.200
 show you.

1345
01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.300
so if this was the square Matrix

1346
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.500
It's eigenvector turned out to be.

1347
01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:46.800
this

1348
01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.300
It was three. Whoops.

1349
01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:08.100
It was three and one.

1350
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:17.700
and

1351
01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:22.700
this was equal to

1352
01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.100
24

1353
01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.700
to 24

1354
01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:31.500
and

1355
01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:36.800
8

1356
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.200
When we want what do we do the when we multiply

1357
01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:44.800
 this matrix by the vector, we'll get 24.

1358
01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.300
and 8 which we can also represent as

1359
01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.800
8 so we can Factor the scalar eight from these two

1360
01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.300
 components to get.

1361
01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.900
three and one multiply 8

1362
01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:05.700
 by 34

1363
01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:09.300
And it turns out that eight was the eigenvalue one

1364
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:10.400
 of the eigenvalues we found.

1365
01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:12.500
so the eigenvalue

1366
01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.800
which we represent or

1367
01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.900
the note would Lambda.

1368
01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.200
was equal to 8

1369
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.400
and I've had we also use two if we had gone through

1370
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:28.100
 the whole process with number two. We would also found another eigenvector.

1371
01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.000
Okay.

1372
01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:44.800
so this

1373
01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:47.800
was a

1374
01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.300
times Lambda

1375
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.000
make the Lambda bold because

1376
01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.100
it's an eigenvector.

1377
01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.100
equals B

1378
01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.500
characteristic polynomial

1379
01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.300
and we lost supposed to talk about the inversion of

1380
01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:46.800
 a matrix.

1381
01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.400
I have notes for

1382
01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.700
in a version of a matrix, but even that's that's

1383
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.900
I would have to spend a few minutes or like

1384
01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.400
 10 minutes to go through those steps, but

1385
01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.500
here are the comments I have.

1386
01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.300
So we will I'm not sure if you can cover this on Wednesday.

1387
01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.900
But I think the notes.

1388
01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:22.000
If you go through the notes should be able to understand how

1389
01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:24.800
 to calculate the inverse of a matrix because

1390
01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.100
 we've already covered the prerequisite which is Gauss elimination.

1391
01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.100
 So here

1392
01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.100
the inverse of a matrix

1393
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.100
Is a matrix when multiplied by the

1394
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.100
 original gives you an identity Matrix?

1395
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:48.100
so

1396
01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.800
Actually, there are two prerequisites gaussian

1397
01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:59.300
 elimination.

1398
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:00.400
and

1399
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.600
if you remember from Led composition

1400
01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.000
 we talked about keeping track.

1401
01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.100
of the elimination matrices well

1402
01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:19.600
I don't have a written down here. But it my

1403
01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.600
 point is as in order to get to be so we have this a in

1404
01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.500
 order to get to be what we will first to is argument.

1405
01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.300
Argument this eight maybe this two by

1406
01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.200
 two for example with the identity Matrix.

1407
01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.300
And then we use gaussian elimination.

1408
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:35.700
to get to

1409
01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:39.500
the

1410
01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.500
inverse of the Matrix which will be in the

1411
01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:46.100
 second chord in the second half. So let me see if

1412
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.400
 I can show you what I mean. I will type here.

1413
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.500
inverse of a matrix

1414
01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.900
Hopefully we'll get the picture that we want.

1415
01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:57.300
augmented

1416
01:28:58.200 --> 01:28:59.300
identity

1417
01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:18.800
Yeah, this is the one.

1418
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.500
So we'll put the picture.

1419
01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.300
So this is the let's say this. Let's say

1420
01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:30.800
 this is your original Matrix.

1421
01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.200
So here we have a

1422
01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.800
but let's just imagine a was actually equal to this three

1423
01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:39.300
 by three.

1424
01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:41.000
this three by three

1425
01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:45.700
why you then do use the argumented by an identity Matrix

1426
01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:48.000
 and we know it's identity because we have one's across the

1427
01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:52.100
 diagonal zero elsewhere. Well we're then going to do is use Gauss

1428
01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:54.500
 elimination like we learned in the

1429
01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:55.000
 previous sessions.

1430
01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:02.100
two well eliminate all

1431
01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:04.400
 three rows and remember to eliminate is

1432
01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.200
 to have once

1433
01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.500
across the diagonal

1434
01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:12.100
the purpose of this augmented Matrix is to keep

1435
01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:15.200
 track of the elimination just like we did in LED composition.

1436
01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.100
So we do these Gauss and elevation Etc. And then

1437
01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.200
 eventually we'll get to this point.

1438
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.400
This is the solution.

1439
01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:26.900
Or this is the this is the row reduce row

1440
01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:29.600
 Echelon form of the original Matrix and this

1441
01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.600
 Matrix to the right.

1442
01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:36.200
Is the the elimination of Matrix it

1443
01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.900
 has we have kept track of the operations we've done.

1444
01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:41.700
This is now the inverse.

1445
01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:42.900
of

1446
01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:44.400
that

1447
01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:47.400
So this Matrix down here?

1448
01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:51.200
The augmented part is the inverse of

1449
01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.000
 that multiply this.

1450
01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:57.100
and that and you will get an identity Matrix you will get

1451
01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.300
This Matrix again. You might

1452
01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:04.600
 ask a question like yes today. What is a practical application of?

1453
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.800
the inverse of a matrix on its own

1454
01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.100
Nothing interesting.

1455
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.500
But it is in more.

1456
01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.100
Advanced linear algebraic techniques will this will

1457
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:19.200
 become in handy so for PCA

1458
01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:23.600
and for SVD, we need to use eigenvalue eigenvectors,

1459
01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.200
 which I'll only know when they're not so interesting.

1460
01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:28.200
Similarly, there will be other situations where we will

1461
01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.100
 need to know the identity of The Matrix.

1462
01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:31.200
Okay.

1463
01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:33.000
anyway

1464
01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:38.000
We've run out of time. I was hoping we would do more and we

1465
01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:40.200
 could do an exercise, but I'm just gonna have to write these

1466
01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:43.500
 as I'm gonna have to share this to tutorial. I'll take the

1467
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.200
 notes from the iPad turn it into a

1468
01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800
markdown file

1469
01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.200
and maybe add my comments in here because we need

1470
01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.100
 to cover these before Wednesday.

1471
01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:53.600
So

1472
01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:55.100
yes.

1473
01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.100
there won't be a video but hopefully

1474
01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.300
the writing will suffice

1475
01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:02.500
and then on Wednesday, we will talk about

1476
01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:06.300
SVD and we will look at practical applications. So

1477
01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:07.300
 we will go back to python.

1478
01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:11.200
I will give you a data set and we will use SVD.

1479
01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:12.600
and then Friday

1480
01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:17.200
We will look at the example. You know that even the one gave

1481
01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.100
 us portfolio optimization.

1482
01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:23.500
And then in module 4, like I said module 4 we will talk

1483
01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.100
 about new networks. So we'll

1484
01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.400
talk about these things. We call input layers

1485
01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.400
 hidden layers upper layers.

1486
01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:33.100
Then we will install tensorflow which will allow us

1487
01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:36.400
 to build your networks. And then we'll see how we can use PCA for

1488
01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:39.700
pattern recognition

1489
01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:40.800
Okay.

1490
01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.700
So hopefully the next Workshop will be more.

1491
01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:49.100
Interesting to you, but we did have to cover these prerequisites. Okay

1492
01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:49.400
 everybody.

1493
01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:53.000
Thank you so much. I will upload these notes.

1494
01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.900
As soon as possible no later than tomorrow morning.

1495
01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.000
But I'll until next time. Take care. Bye.
