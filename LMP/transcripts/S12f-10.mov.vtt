Let me show you a picture of softmax function.

1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.500
And they're very similar in that they are.

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.000
used for

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.100
assigning to every

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.700
feature distribution

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.000
a

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.100
class in the case of sigmo. It will

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.300
 be a binary classification.

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300
And the case of softmax it will be.

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.800
multi-class classification

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.800
but we have this s looking curve.

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.800
and if a feature is

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.000
You know below the threshold.

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.300
it will be given zero if it's binary and

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.000
 one otherwise

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.700
Let me first begin with.

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.200
a binary example

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
And then we can generalize it for multi-class classification.

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.100
 So before I talk about softmax, let me talk about

19
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.300
 sigmoid first because it's easier to talk about.

20
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.800
It's easy to derive the sigmoid function because it's binary.

21
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.200
And the prerequisites are this.

22
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.100
I'll just take you to this other application I've built.

23
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.000
I used to you sometimes users for teaching

24
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 it's called a box map.

25
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.300
They bring us over here.

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.000
Okay. So these are the people in order for us

27
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.400
 to understand the sigmoid function otherwise known as expert. These are

28
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.200
 the prerequisites.

29
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.900
So I'm going to open each box.

30
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.700
and quickly take you through the

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.200
the

32
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
explanation the sigma function is given by this formula.

33
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.100
So, let's see what this is. Why why this

34
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.900
Okay, so let's see. Let's get this derivation.

35
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.500
first of all, if the number of probability is a

36
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.800
 number between a real number between 0 and 1

37
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.500
so

38
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.300
and it's given by this number is given by a ratio.

39
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.900
 It is the total outcomes.

40
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.600
In the denominator and the chosen outcomes

41
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.100
 on the numerator. So for example, let's consider flipping a coin.

42
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.800
or flipping

43
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.200
two coins

44
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.300
and you want to know what is the probability of getting either heads

45
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.400
 and tails or two tails or two heads?

46
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.700
The total number of outcomes are these three you

47
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.400
 can get two heads two tails or one has

48
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.000
 entails and this is a combination not a permutation so

49
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.500
 we don't care about the order of the coin.

50
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.100
So it doesn't matter if you get it tells their heads or head to tell

51
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.700
 with the same thing.

52
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.900
And you want to know what is a probability of getting two tails?

53
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.000
Well you well, there's only one.

54
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.500
such

55
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.000
outcome

56
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.300
from your total number of outcomes. So that's one over three

57
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.600
 or 33%

58
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600
if we can round it up to 34% if you want.

59
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.300
The chance of getting it tails on the Tails when you

60
00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.900
 flip two coins.

61
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.200
Is 33%

62
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.100
that's probably

63
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.500
okay.

64
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.200
A several example is flipping one coin. How many

65
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.300
 outcomes you have? You only have two heads or tails. So what is

66
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.200
 it probably of getting ahead?

67
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.000
50%

68
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.300
your total number of outcomes is two and then your chosen

69
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.200
 outcomes one. So 1 over 2. That's 50%

70
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.600
Of course, assuming you have a perfectly balanced coin.

71
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.300
Then we have odds.

72
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.900
Odds is a is the ratio of two probabilities.

73
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.600
For example, you want to know what is the probability of getting a

74
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.600
let's say you have two people who are very

75
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.200
 making a bet.

76
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.500
And we want to know who has a higher probability of winning the

77
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.700
 bet.

78
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.200
One person bets on getting a tails and a

79
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.400
 tails the other person gets bets on getting either heads or

80
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.700
 heads.

81
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200
or heads and tails

82
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.900
so they have

83
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.400
a higher probability because they have more

84
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.200
the their number of chosen outcomes is greater.

85
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.200
And you might say this is unfair. Well so are

86
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.700
 many so is the real world, right? So for example in horse betting

87
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.600
people who can buy more bets have more number

88
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.700
 of outcomes if they better more horses naturally have

89
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.800
 a higher probability of winning.

90
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.500
Whereas if I buy if I put all my money on one horse. Well, I

91
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500
 have a smaller problem and that's that's what odds is

92
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.300
 the odds of that. Let's say you have bet on three horses

93
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.400
 or in this case. Let's say it's two because we

94
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.400
 have your number of choice. Your number of outcomes is

95
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.200
 closed the total number of outcomes.

96
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.400
You'd have a higher probability. So if you compare you're probably versus

97
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.700
 my probability, that's the odds ratio.

98
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.100
The odds would be in your favor you would have

99
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.300
 twice.

100
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.700
The odds of you winning is twice as high.

101
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.400
We'd also the probability is how you say the odds

102
00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.300
 is twice as high.

103
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.400
because if we divide your probability over my probability

104
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.300
 we will get to

105
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.300
okay.

106
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.900
now

107
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.600
another way to express the same ratio.

108
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.900
is to

109
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.200
Take my probability and subtract it from

110
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.600
 one. Why because well

111
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.700
there are three outcomes three three possible outcomes. I

112
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.800
 have taken one of them.

113
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.800
So there are two remaining.

114
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.300
So out of the 100% of the outcomes I have

115
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.500
 taken.

116
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.700
33% of it

117
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.300
That's what 1 minus 3 is. Oh, that's why

118
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.300
 we have one minus P TT. So if

119
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.000
 I had no

120
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.000
if you are taking all three.

121
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.300
Outcomes you would have 100% probability of

122
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.100
 winning because you have bet on all three outcomes. But if I

123
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.400
 take one of them you have one less than the entirety.

124
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.100
 That's why we have one minus PTT. Either way. You will get

125
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.900
 the same number.

126
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.200
Okay. Now why do we want to re-express the

127
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.900
 problem the express the odds ratio in this way because this is

128
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.900
 going to bring us to log on.

129
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.700
the log odds is about taking the

130
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.100
now if you see here what we have

131
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.400
 done is we have inverted.

132
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.000
the ratio

133
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.900
Okay. So this was P of X in the

134
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.700
 denominator and 1 minus P of X in the numerator here.

135
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.400
 We've just flipped it. I just

136
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.300
a reversed in the previous example this you can understand the Arts

137
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.700
 and the anal index and the analogy of two people betting and

138
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.400
 one has

139
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.600
they have the luxury of more chosen outcomes

140
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.000
 than the other person.

141
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.900
but if we flip it around

142
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.500
we will get

143
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.000
We will still have the ratio but we

144
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.300
 have a problem.

145
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.700
the reason we use logarithm

146
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.500
In any context of probability, so there's something called likelihood and

147
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.200
 maximum likelihood you may have heard of this. The reason

148
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.400
 we use a lot of rhythmic function is to change

149
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.400
 the scale of the probability. You see the number can

150
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.100
 be very small if I have for example

151
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.900
0.05 probability over

152
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:32.500
 let's say

153
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.200
1 minus P of X will be

154
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.900
 1 minus.

155
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.200
0.5.

156
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.000
You see the probability is very small.

157
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.100
0.5%

158
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.400
and

159
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.600
in the case of multi-class classification, you will

160
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.400
 have all of these very tiny properties 5% 1% less

161
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.000
 than 1%

162
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.600
So for arithmetic purposes and in particular competition purposes

163
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.500
We want to kind of rescale.

164
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.900
The probability so for example, if I take 5% and

165
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.500
 I put it in the logarithmic function and the base of

166
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.100
 the logarithm is not really important. I have changed the scale.

167
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.700
So it's not one point negative 1.3.

168
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.300
Okay, so really what I want to get across is

169
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.700
 this the choice of the base is not that important.

170
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.400
But we want to apply the log rhythmic function just to

171
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.200
 change the scale. And of course log base of e is just the natural

172
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.000
 log with natural logarithm.

173
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:36.900
Okay.

174
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.900
Then we have the logite function. The logite function is really that when

175
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.500
 you apply the logarithmic function to your odds,

176
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.100
 that's where you call the logit function.

177
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.300
So let me zoom out.

178
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.400
So the expression we saw previously, that's the logic.

179
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.000
And it turns out when you evaluate this

180
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.300
 expression it is the same thing as evaluating beta

181
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.100
 Subs 0 and Beta Support. Now, what is better

182
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.100
 Sub Zero better sub one.

183
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.800
These are the coefficients.

184
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.900
of the regression model

185
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.000
so

186
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.400
did I reference to the regression model anywhere else?

187
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.200
Not here.

188
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.500
So let's move this up here.

189
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.300
And for Simplicity, let me remove the other.

190
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.600
Variables and let's just say we have two.

191
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.200
You have two variables.

192
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.700
The Epsilon is the residual.

193
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.500
That's the error rate. Let me not include that

194
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.400
 in here either just really keep it simple.

195
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.300
and let's just have beta sub 1

196
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.500
so beta Sub Zero is what we call the bias term.

197
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.400
Or the Y. It's the number of the Y intercept

198
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.900
 so in the value function the bias or the x-axis in

199
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.000
 the general regression model devices and the

200
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:20.600
 y axis.

201
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.100
This is the y-intercept.

202
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.900
and this is the

203
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.300
x sub one is the feature and this

204
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.400
 is its weight.

205
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.400
Now we talking we'll talk about real estate signs of

206
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.000
 the property number of bedrooms, etc. Etc.

207
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.400
X sub one is one feature and

208
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.500
 beta sub one. It's it's the weight associated with the correct

209
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.600
 weight associated with it.

210
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:46.600
Okay.

211
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.400
That's where beat is up 0 and better someone come from.

212
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.900
so if we return this the logic function

213
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.100
the

214
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.400
Numerical value that we'll get from a validity this expression

215
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.600
 is the same as that expression.

216
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.200
If we apply if we want to get rid of the logarithm if you

217
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.400
 want to change the scale again.

218
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.400
We will have to take this expression.

219
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.800
And to raise it to the exponential function

220
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.600
 to cancel to eliminate log.

221
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.300
And that's what we do here.

222
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.200
We've taken the expression above.

223
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.100
And raise it to e but that mean but this is

224
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.100
 algebra. So we have to do it other side as well.

225
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.700
Then of course e to the power log e will get eliminated.

226
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.900
and this expression

227
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.000
whoops this expression comes down here.

228
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.100
Now in order to derive the sigma function, we have to do some allergy break

229
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.600
 manipulation.

230
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.400
Which is going to be a multiple steps to what I'm going to do is I'm going to avoid that instead what I've

231
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:55.500
 done.

232
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:56.900
is I have

233
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.600
created

234
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.000
if you can go to symbol lab what you looked at before to basically

235
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.100
 move one minus P of x to the other

236
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.900
 side and then after a little bit of algebraic manipulation.

237
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.100
We get this.

238
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.000
This is the formula. Basically this is

239
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.100
 odds. This is the odds.

240
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.400
In the context of binary classification we're asking what is

241
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.300
 the what is the probability of it being this

242
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.300
 class versus being in that class? What is that?

243
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.000
 Probably of being of this particular?

244
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.000
feature

245
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.600
being fraud versus not front. What is

246
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.300
 a odds of this being?

247
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.100
Well, actually probability so we have taken the concept of

248
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.100
 odds and we have now representing as making it

249
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.300
 a probabilistic number. So what is it now the probability of

250
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.300
 being a Spam versus the probability of not being spam. What

251
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.700
 is it? What is the probability of it being?

252
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.300
An animal versus that probably of it not being in that's the

253
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:02.600
 idea here.

254
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.300
Okay.

255
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.200
so this was very

256
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.400
sped up.

257
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:10.800
explanation of

258
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.800
the sigboid function

259
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.200
So what do we will do is then every time we get a feature?

260
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.100
it will be a

261
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.500
it's valuable be inside.

262
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.300
The probability of it being in a class versus the probability of

263
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:28.900
 not being in the class.

264
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:32.900
Okay.

265
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:35.500
and so that's what

266
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.200
the sigmoid is going to do.

267
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.400
if it can if it goes above the threshold we'll

268
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.200
 classified as

269
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.400
Let's see fraud if it falls below the threshold will

270
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.200
 classify it as non-front binary classification.

271
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.300
So the observations will end up up here or down here.

272
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.600
Yeah, and apparently sigmoid is a term used

273
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.400
 in medicine as well.
