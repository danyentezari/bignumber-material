00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.400
Okay, so first we'll begin with determinate.

1
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.600
The permanent this should be okay determinant.

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.800
A matrix now, of course, we can only calculate determinant

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 office of matrices that are square.

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.200
So consider the following example, this is very straightforward and we have

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.900
 a matrix.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.500
the determinant of a matrix

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.000
is denoted by the ET to compute

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.400
 the

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.100
determinant of a

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.800
square Matrix is to

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.600
take the product.

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.300
of the components across

13
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.500
the diagonal

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.300
this is only true for the square major for our two by two. I'll show you how it's

15
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.000
 not worth 2 by 3.

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.400
Take the product of a a sub 1

17
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.800
 1 and a sub 2 2 so across this diagonal.

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.000
Then take the product of the opposite diagonal

19
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.400
 or the opposite direction and then sum

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.600
 them.

21
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.300
so determinant of a 2 by 2 Matrix is

22
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.800
for a 3 by 3 or yeah for

23
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.000
 a three by three or larger.

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.200
let me

25
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.500
let me let me show you how it's done.

26
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.100
I'm going to so this is for us. This is for

27
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.500
 our two by two four.

28
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.900
two by two Matrix

29
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.000
for three by three

30
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.900
Okay, so let's add one more Row one more column.

31
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.000
now

32
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.200
to calculate this

33
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.500
maybe augment this let me copy paste the

34
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.400
 same Matrix. So becomes e visually easier to

35
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.300
See, I'm gonna copy that bit.

36
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.900
And I'm going to copy it once more.

37
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.800
And let me actually put them next to each other.

38
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.100
Okay, let's put some line break.

39
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.800
in order to calculate the determinant of

40
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.400
the three by three

41
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.400
we're going to multiply.

42
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.200
again

43
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.400
everything across the diagonal so this times this

44
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.600
times this

45
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.600
so the third column of the third row.

46
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.200
But then we also have to multiply these components.

47
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.100
And those components so on the upper triangle the lower triangle. How

48
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.500
 do we do this?

49
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.300
Well, the reason I augmented this Matrix is because we want to

50
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.300
 multiply three components three components three components.

51
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.200
 So after Computing the elements

52
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.300
 across the main diagonal then we're going

53
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.400
 to multiply a12.

54
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.700
times a23

55
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.000
and then a31

56
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.000
So this element?

57
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.300
Will come all the way up here.

58
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.600
Maybe it's and let me also just show you this from a different angle. So

59
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.900
 I'm going to type in determinant.

60
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.400
of a 3 by 3 Matrix

61
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.400
and let's use yeah, here we go.

62
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.200
So this is this this is a three by three which has been

63
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.700
 argumented.

64
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.600
Okay.

65
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.000
So we multiply the products across the main diagonal.

66
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.100
And then we have B sub 1 C sub 2.

67
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.600
Which we wanted me to multiply with a sub 3. So we're

68
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.200
 going to copy a sub three all the way here. I mean that's all point of

69
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.600
 mirroring.

70
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.600
Or reflecting if you want this Matrix so

71
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.100
 we can have this.

72
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.900
business this diagonal business

73
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.200
And then of once we've done it from there, once we've done

74
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.300
 across the main dial will go the other direction. So C sub 1

75
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.500
 B sub 2 a sub 3

76
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.200
and then a sub 1 is up to so

77
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.700
 basically exactly what I just said.

78
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.300
Okay.

79
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400
These elements these elements and these elements. So you

80
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
 see when we when we copy The Matrix.

81
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.200
Now in the examples I showed you an example you will see they will

82
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.900
 leave the spit out.

83
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.700
But I think it's just more clear if I make a duplicate.

84
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.900
Okay, so let's look at an example.

85
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800
Just two by two.

86
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.800
And then we'll move on to the next topic.

87
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.600
So let's say

88
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.900
we have

89
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.700
the square Matrix. I'm going to copy paste.

90
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.900
code

91
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.800
and let's say we have

92
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.900
You know, whatever this will be for.

93
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.400
This will be three.

94
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.600
This will be eight.

95
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.100
and let's make this 2

96
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.400
so 2 times 3 minus 8 times 2

97
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.700
Now what will this evaluate to there? So that will be six minus 16.

98
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.200
so negative 10

99
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.000
That's the determinant of this Matrix.

100
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.400
Now we leave this here and come back to it.

101
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.500
To well, of course for every concept that

102
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.900
 we see here. We want to know what's what's

103
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.100
A practically example of using the determined. So let's keep

104
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.300
 this year so we can refer to later on.
