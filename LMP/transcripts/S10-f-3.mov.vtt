This equation is from a book.

1
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.800
from Shadow aggarwal a very

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.500
popular author of all kinds of machine learning

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.700
 books

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.700
And he's very well written I would strongly recommend

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.000
 any of his books. He has a book on.

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.600
Machine learning for text. I recommend it. He has a book on data mining

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.300
 I recommend it is a book on using

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.500
 machine learning or data money for healthcare. I recommend

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.400
 that too. In fact, I recommend all of his books, but here

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.000
 let's just pay attention to this the formula.

11
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.200
 We want to understand the formula here.

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.100
We can see we have w.

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.100
Now this author I guess does not use the Bold.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.600
Convention, I would prefer that they did.

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.700
But that's the Matrix the transpose of the Matrix multiplied by

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.500
 the scale value, which here is the mean?

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.600
of the data

18
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.000
this five function is the activation function what I

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.600
 try to really say, is that a neural network?

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.500
Is linear algebra?

21
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.400
So what we're going to do is look at we will look at the mathematical representation

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.700
 of it.

23
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.500
And look at it in its python

24
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 implementation.

25
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.500
but we'll start with the python implementation first because that's

26
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.100
we want to get the ball rolling ball rolling.

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.300
Okay.

28
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.400
so we want to understand the

29
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.400
terms here the symbols here. What's what exactly

30
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.700
 like what's this calculation?

31
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.800
and then

32
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.700
you know, we will have a thorough and foundational understanding

33
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.900
 of

34
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.700
a neural networks
