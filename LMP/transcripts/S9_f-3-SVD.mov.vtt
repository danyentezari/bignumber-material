And let me copied copy paste this because this double

1
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.300
 it's very similar for step two for step two.

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.700
 It will be

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.200
well the same thing but the order will be reversed.

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.500
Okay.

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.000
That's a time is transpose.

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.100
Up here the transpose.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.800
times a

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.200
and here I just need to reverse the order.

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.300
I'm going to get this Matrix. So one of four one four six.

10
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.000
so

11
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.200
one or four

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.400
one four six

13
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.700
72 72

14
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.000
72 72

15
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.100
Okay.

16
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.000
So I see this these two steps are missing from this this

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 formulation.
