00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.100
When we see artificial intelligence, you know, what what is it

1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.300
 that comes to mind we picture.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.700
A situation where we have these humanoids these Androids

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.300
 these robots.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.600
who are

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.300
If not, as if not Superior to us in

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.400
 a talents, they are equal to wasn't intelligence. Now. You

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.700
 see this in many movies, you know these robots.

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.700
They have very human-like.

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.600
Intellectual capabilities and there are two two.

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.500
What do we call it two?

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.300
groups of

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.300
thinking

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700
And one group we have people say who advocate for developing artificial

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.100
 intelligence.

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.200
Because you know we can train these robots. We

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.500
 can build these robots who will help us, you know, improve the quality

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.000
 of our life.

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.100
You know to use economic terms increase improve our

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.600
 utility.

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.300
We can do less work.

21
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.300
whether it's the boreas work,

22
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.600
 you know working in the mines or

23
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.000
You know anything that is physically demanding

24
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.300
 or even you know situations like

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.700
 this where you have to do very laborious.

26
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.400
technical work

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.100
and these robots can come here and do the

28
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.300
 work for us or call at least at the various collaborate with us and you

29
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.100
 know, make our lives easier.

30
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.700
And the second group of people have this perception, right

31
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.500
 if we make them too smart.

32
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.900
Then it will be a matter of time before they come and take, you know,

33
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
 come knocking on our doors and well

34
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.000
 you get you get the picture.

35
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200
There is a there is a one.

36
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.700
Theoretical explanation why?

37
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.800
We cannot produce computers that can.

38
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.200
extrapolate

39
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.900
learn from extrapolation

40
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.100
and there was also a

41
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.800
practical explanation fire why it's not possible to create such, you

42
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.900
 know sentient things.

43
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.800
First let's talk about the three categories

44
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.900
 of artificial intelligence.

45
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.400
Okay.

46
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.100
We have the most primitive, which is narrow AI.

47
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.900
And the most Superior which is of course Superior.

48
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.500
Narrow AI is really what we call machine learning.

49
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.000
And another name for machine learning as you may you know is

50
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.500
 statistical learning. It's really just statistical techniques.

51
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.600
used

52
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.400
on large volumes of data

53
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.400
Basically, it is a lot of the Redundant tasks that

54
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.100
 a statistics would do a lot of the every basic arithmetic.

55
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.400
That is that a decision would do and it is automated with

56
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.900
 software. That's what machine learning is machine learning is in

57
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.600
 very simple terms statistics.

58
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.900
automated

59
00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.400
now

60
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.500
obviously there's more to a status job than

61
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.700
calculating simple things like

62
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.400
dispersion and variation

63
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.300
But a lot of it is automated a lot of the things that

64
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.500
 a session would do in order to perform dialysis is

65
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.800
 very mundane machine learning automates machine

66
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.100
 learning about automating most of that.

67
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.700
Okay.

68
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.300
And it will only a machine learning model will be useful

69
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.600
 so long as there is no such as so

70
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.400
 long as there's no significant concept shift now.

71
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.300
Now that I've had concept shift. This is in order

72
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.400
 to explain what that is. We have to go to different realm. Basically. It is

73
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.500
 a significant shift in the distribution of data, and that

74
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.700
 isn't the realm of ml Ops machine learning Ops

75
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.900
by the way, if you want to know what Machinery offices I've recorded a

76
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.200
workshop you can watch that and you can you can see what that is.

77
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.800
 So it's about machine learning put a production. So and these three next workshops. We're

78
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.100
 going to look at machine learning on our computers.

79
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.600
but

80
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.300
we don't want to just be on the computer. We want it to be on the cloud. But then once

81
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.500
 it's on the cloud you need to monitor it that's what level Ops is about. Anyway, I just

82
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.200
 want to let's stick to here and

83
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.300
I'll tell you what we can learn more about machine learning.

84
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.000
Anyway, so we have three layers.

85
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.500
narrow AI is

86
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.800
using machine learning to do very

87
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.300
well narrow tasks, for example.

88
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.200
Speech to text.

89
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.500
For example, it's like a

90
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.600
 narrow.

91
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.300
As a human being you're capable of doing many things,

92
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.400
 correct.

93
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.000
You're able to perform any tasks.

94
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.700
Make a sandwich.

95
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.600
Make a telephone call recognize somebody's

96
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.100
 face and greet them and so on.

97
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.200
So all of these are narrow tasks that we

98
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.300
 are capable of doing and now ai is using machine

99
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.800
 learning to machine learning to do to use one of these to perform

100
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.700
 one of these now tasks.

101
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.100
Speech text is an example where you listen to audio.

102
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.900
And then you make a transcript of it.

103
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.700
If you go to YouTube and you play a video there is the closed caption

104
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.100
 option when you click the Switch.

105
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.600
and

106
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.800
there is the text corresponding to the speaking

107
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.000
 person.

108
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.100
It's not accurate all the time. There's a lot of mistakes

109
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.400
 in it, but that's an example of narrow AI.

110
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.100
Now the ones image classification what you feed the model of

111
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.100
 pictures and the model will say this is a card. This is a truck. This is a cat

112
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.800
 Etc.

113
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.400
Now we are currently here.

114
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.300
Generally AI.

115
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.600
Is where we just stage where?

116
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.300
The system we have whether it's using machine learning

117
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.400
 or a combination of machine learning and rules-based systems

118
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.900
 rules bases you but the the construction program

119
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.100
 if and else statements that kind of thing.

120
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.200
So generally is where we have a system.

121
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.300
That can't that is equal to us.

122
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.900
in a

123
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.300
intellectual capacity

124
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.500
so if you have a system that can

125
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.000
learn like you think like you communicate like

126
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.600
 you then we have reached General AI.

127
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.100
Now why is it? Why are we quite far

128
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.100
 from getting to Super AI?

129
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.900
In order for us to get to Super AI.

130
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.900
That is a stage where?

131
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.300
Machines are superior to us and intelligence.

132
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.100
Who was first be able to replicate our own intelligence?

133
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.200
It makes sense, right? How can we exceed ourselves if

134
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.100
 we cannot replicate our metal capabilities?

135
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.200
that is

136
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.000
getting to General AI so and why are we not able to get

137
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.800
 the general AI?

138
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.700
because

139
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.300
What is a human being like what what is it?

140
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.700
 That makes us intelligent? It's our brain.

141
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.800
Yes.

142
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.300
well, the thing is we don't know much about we don't know as

143
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.100
 much about as we don't know much about the brain as much as

144
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.200
 we

145
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.300
want to know

146
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.700
And this is not realm of biology and psychology. We

147
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.900
 know a great deal about the paint but not enough to replicate

148
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.100
 it.

149
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.900
you know, you've heard the story, you know, what what they

150
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.200
examine Einstein's brain just to see what's going on.

151
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.400
 We still don't know. What what's we don't we still don't know all the

152
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.200
 intricacies of human brain. So, how could we supersede? How

153
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.100
 can we ever produce a just a super? Yeah, if we don't

154
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.300
 even know how our own brains work.

155
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.800
And we still here.

156
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.200
So this is a practically commission. There's also a theoretical explanation but

157
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.100
That's discussion for a later time.

158
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.200
having said that

159
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.000
of all the machine learning techniques that we have available to us deep

160
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.700
 learning is the most sophisticated why because deep

161
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.700
 learning is the is our

162
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.100
attempt to replicate the human brain

163
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.500
as close as possible.

164
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.900
so deep learning

165
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.200
Is how we can never get to this point if we can get to

166
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.500
 this point?
