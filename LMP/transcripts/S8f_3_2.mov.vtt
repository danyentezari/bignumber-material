00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
So for the first thing we are going to do.

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.700
is

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.500
Get the characteristic polynomial.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.000
And to do that we will need the determinant.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.100
function

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.700
whose argument

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.900
is the identity Matrix multiplied?

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.900
By Lambda, let me write it down. So we will

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.200
 have

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.900
times are in linear algebra. I is the identity

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.400
 Matrix.

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.500
And step two will be the characteristic polynomial.

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.100
So we have if you remember we said that the identity Matrix.

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.100
Since the Matrix a is a 2 by 2

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.400
 the identity Matrix will be a 2 by 2.

15
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.600
Yes, if we multiply the scalar.

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.300
With the identity Matrix, what do we get? So we have

17
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.400
 the scale of Lambda?

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.200
Whose value is to be determined? That's why this function

19
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 called determinant.

20
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.900
We are trying to determine the the undetermined

21
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.700
 which and that undetermine is that Lambda.

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.700
a Greek letter

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.900
So what we will do is then we will take this identity Matrix.

24
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.700
multiplied by Lambda

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.600
2 well, we know what we see what happens in Jupiter

26
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.100
 notebook when you multiply the scalar.

27
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.400
product on the what the identity Matrix

28
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.300
just for clarity. I'm going to use the

29
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.300
time symbol

30
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.700
so multiply that Skiller and these will be replaced.

31
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.800
So we can put this scalar here next to

32
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.000
 it.

33
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.200
And this will give us a new Matrix.

34
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.000
But all the ones have now become.

35
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.500
Lambda

36
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.600
this

37
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.500
we will then put inside the determinate function.
