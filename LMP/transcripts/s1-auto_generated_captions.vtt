Hello everybody. Welcome to

1
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.100
This session on.

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.500
linear mathematics with python

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.600
now this session is actually the

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.400
 first session of

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.000
a four-week course

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.100
titled linear mathematics with python

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.400
Now I will take you.

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.000
through the

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.100
curriculum

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.300
You know the topics that will cover and those

11
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.600
 four weeks.

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.800
but in the

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.700
last third of the session

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.800
so first I will give you an introduction.

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.100
high level introduction as usual

16
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.000
to

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.000
You know what? We mean by a leader in mathematics.

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.000
We will talk about the applications of linear mathematics and

19
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.400
 very importantly.

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.700
the prerequisites

21
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.000
as you know, it was as we have said before.

22
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.200
Mathematics is never something you could cover in a short span of

23
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.400
 time.

24
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.000
Like in one hour and a half we could not become experts and

25
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000
 linear algebra, but what we can do.

26
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.900
but what we can do is

27
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.200
learn the fundamentals that we independently can learn.

28
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.700
Linear algebra or whatever bunch of mathematics. Let

29
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.200
 me just answer this question. Where can I please find a

30
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.700
 copy of the record? The recording will be a little available after today's Workshop?

31
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.000
If you join the slack Channel.

32
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.100
The link for which is in the Meetup page where you

33
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.700
 always repeat you will find the link to slack when you go to slack you'll

34
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.800
 find.

35
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.100
Updates there's also the big number Dash, but if you go to

36
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.000
 the big number website.

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100
And you enroll yourself in this course?

38
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.400
And all doesn't take much you just put in your email address click

39
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.100
 on enroll and you have access to the material.

40
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.900
So either slack or the website itself?

41
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.700
Okay, let's talk about the topics very

42
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.100
 quickly. So like I said quick overview of

43
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.300
 linear algebra, like what are the

44
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.200
Main components that will be covered in this course.

45
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.100
Then of course the linear programming.

46
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.200
The prerequisites like what you should expect to

47
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.900
 go through.

48
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.200
to we know

49
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.400
be able to read a literature on linear algebra

50
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.000
 and apply.

51
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.000
techniques

52
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.900
from linear algebra and I'll give you a real good example one

53
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.500
 of many examples that will cover in this.

54
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.900
in the course

55
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.300
now I haven't listed it

56
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.900
 here but a big part of

57
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.200
Applying linear algebra in

58
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.500
 the real world is with python in particular.

59
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.900
the library numpy

60
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.400
We'll talk about that as well.

61
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.100
But the numpy itself is reserved for

62
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.500
 different session. Okay?

63
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.700
What is the linear algebra?

64
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200
linear algebra

65
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.500
is actually a subset.

66
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.100
of

67
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.300
Abstract algebra, which I'm going

68
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.000
 to be talking about today.

69
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.000
So even though this code is called linear algebra.

70
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.900
We really can't have a meaningful discussion.

71
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.400
If we are not.

72
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400
speaking the same language or if we do not understand

73
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.300
 each other because

74
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.000
In the context of linear algebra. We are going to

75
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.800
 use certain words certain terms.

76
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.400
And unless we know those terms and you know.

77
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.300
We're not going to make a much progress. Now. Where

78
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.100
 do we find the definitions for those terms?

79
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.700
abstract audio

80
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.300
so they are part of each other.

81
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.300
Okay linear algebra, like I said is a subset.

82
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.000
Of abstract algebra in other words if you

83
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.800
 learn abstract algebra, you're on your weight. You're learning linear algebra.

84
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.900
Now in this course, there are two major components.

85
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.900
There are two things that we are going to try to cover in depth.

86
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.500
the first

87
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.400
category is the systems of linear equations.

88
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.700
one of the very

89
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.200
impressive things in linear algebra

90
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.000
Is that it gives us techniques?

91
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.500
For solving multiple equations at

92
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.400
 the same time. It allows us to find the roots.

93
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.900
of multiple equations at the same time

94
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.300
why is that important well and

95
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.500
You know, what's the point of what's so in?

96
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.800
important about finding roots of an equation

97
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.600
I think I'll come back to that answer once.

98
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.200
We go to mark down because

99
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.400
 I want to show you some math expressions.

100
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.200
Okay, but equations.

101
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.700
Which can sometimes stand for models?

102
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.700
And I hope you know that models.

103
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.100
Are how we mathematically represent some

104
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.500
 thing in the real world?

105
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.200
By finding the roots of an equation.

106
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.900
And if that equation happens to be a model we would

107
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.400
 have found the essence of that model.

108
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.600
And with linear algebra, we're able to do this for a seat

109
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.800
 like a sequencer.

110
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.200
Equations, so that's the first one. Okay

111
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.400
 again, I'm like we always do in every session we start at

112
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.200
 the high level and then delve deeper right because we won't

113
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.300
 have

114
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.600
a picture

115
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.800
of

116
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.100
the discussion

117
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.900
the second part is the Matrix operations.

118
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.300
This will be the bulk of the course and for

119
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.600
 that matter this this encompasses the bulk of any here any linear

120
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.100
 algebra course.

121
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.400
So I'll tell you what the subsets are like what

122
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.600
 roughly goes into each category.

123
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.400
but let me also well actually this is it I this is

124
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.000
 the slide I was gonna

125
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.000
I thought it was a slide that comes after but here are

126
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.400
 the major components that we'll be covered in both

127
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.300
 categories systems of linear equation. Like I said

128
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.400
 allows you to or the set of techniques that allow us

129
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.300
 to solve multiple equations at the same time.

130
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.600
and

131
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.900
we are going to we will achieve this.

132
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.400
by performing

133
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.800
arithmetic operations on multiple rows

134
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.900
And what we want to do is eventually get to something called reduced Echelon

135
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.600
 form or reduced row Echelon form.

136
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.700
Another part of another topic.

137
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.500
 Another thing that we will learn is Lu decomposition.

138
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.000
You know the lower triangle upper triangle decomposition.

139
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.600
and when it comes to Matrix operations we

140
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.700
 have

141
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.900
a set of

142
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.500
special types of matrices

143
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.500
a very important one is a is the

144
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.000
 square Matrix and that diagonal matrix.

145
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.600
These uh types of matrices especially this the

146
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.400
 square Matrix is going to be very Central to the entire

147
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.600
 course because Square matrices of applications in

148
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.100
 neural networks.

149
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.900
In statistics if you've

150
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.300
 heard of things like core variance and correlation matrices.

151
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.400
They have applications. Oh.

152
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.900
principal component analysis, which is

153
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.100
let's say our

154
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.200
What's the word I'm looking for?

155
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.100
It is where we are headed towards so well, and actually it's

156
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.600
 the slide that I want to come to so principal component analysis. How many

157
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.700
 of you have heard of PCA?

158
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.200
They whether you know what it like how to

159
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.100
 evaluate or not. It's not the point. But how many you have heard of

160
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.300
 PC or Episcopal component analysis if it's yes put in y if it's

161
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.300
 a no type in a type of no just want to engage your familiarity with

162
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.600
 some of these things.

163
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.400
Yeah, orange tries as Emma. Yes, because

164
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.100
 it's especially data mining data mining where

165
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.800
 we want to extract patterns and PC is what?

166
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.800
Is one mechanism one knee very powerful mechanism

167
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.700
 that allows us to do that.

168
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:17.900
Okay.

169
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.600
And I've seen here we have people from everywhere.

170
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.100
including Saudi, Arabia Poland

171
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.900
Wow, Boston, welcome to you all.

172
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.300
Okay. So let's see the answers. We have many mostly wise

173
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.300
 and a few ends.

174
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.800
now it's not easy for me to

175
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.300
Like going to PC at least not not just yet.

176
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.200
but

177
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.900
If we are able to find the principal components.

178
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.500
of a matrix

179
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.700
That's a big deal. We can do things like pattern recognition

180
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.500
 whether it's from pictures or tabular

181
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.000
 data or sound bites.

182
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.500
We it is used in stock price prediction.

183
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.200
 So if any of your interested in quantitative Finance PC

184
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.400
 is actually again a very big component

185
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.500
 of

186
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.200
Quantity Finance optimization optimization

187
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.400
 is is a subset of linear

188
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.300
 or a superset of linear program which we

189
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.300
 all talk about today. But PCA will give you a powerful

190
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.600
 ability in many different

191
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.300
 domains that concerns data.

192
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.500
now

193
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.500
in order for us to even be able to comprehend.

194
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.300
How PC works and how you're

195
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.800
 able to extract the principle components from a matrix or

196
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.300
 from our data?

197
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.100
We have this layer.

198
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.200
these layers of prerequisites

199
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.400
So for example PCA is a subset or a subtype

200
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.000
 of sync singular value decomposition.

201
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.800
So in order for us to understand PC, we must understand how

202
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.200
 what SVD is generally speaking.

203
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.000
and the prerequisite for understanding SVD

204
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.500
is knowing something called a characteristic polynomial.

205
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.700
The determinant function from which we can extract eigenvalues and

206
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.100
 eigenvectors. I have a good sense. You most of

207
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.700
 you heard of eigenvales and eigenvectors.

208
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.200
Okay.

209
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.000
And of course, we can only extract eigenvalues eigenvectors

210
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.600
 or rather. We can apply determinate function to only

211
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.400
 a square Matrix, which is one of the many matrices that we

212
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.700
 will encounter, but perhaps the one we will focus mostly

213
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:33.800
 on.

214
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.400
So if you want to pick up a book.

215
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.100
on machine learning

216
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.500
on linear algebra, or if you would come across a Blog and

217
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.200
 you would to try to make sense. You know, what what is the formula

218
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.200
 of PCA? You would get stuck at least I did.

219
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.000
And then I could figure out.

220
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.500
the prerequisites

221
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.300
and

222
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.300
this is this is what it looks like.

223
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.300
So the point I'm trying to make is in this course, we're going to learn linear algebra.

224
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.600
With the goal of eventually understanding

225
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.700
 techniques like PCA.

226
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.600
Now we'll then open.

227
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.200
These opportunities for us.

228
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.200
You know to apply to diff all kinds to many kinds

229
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.500
 of problems in the real world. Okay, so as

230
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.500
 opposed to just learning these topics.

231
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.100
and abstract

232
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.100
and you know an abstract matter. We want

233
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.500
 to see how every single concept applies to practical problems.

234
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.400
And we will do this with python. So you will Implement some of

235
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.700
 these not or not. We cannot Implement all of these techniques

236
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.000
 with

237
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.500
python

238
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.200
so for example, you can we can implement the terminal function

239
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.200
 of python characteristic polynomial.

240
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.400
Is a little bit more.

241
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.700
challenging

242
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.400
but that's all we want to do so in this

243
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.400
Form you would not only learn linear algebra

244
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.200
 an abstract algebra, by the way, you will also

245
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.100
 become much better at Python and specifically not by.

246
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:04.700
Okay.

247
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.400
Let's carry on now. Let's talk about

248
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.400
linear programming

249
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.100
linear programming is very close to linear

250
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.400
 algebra.

251
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.700
And it has this primary component called

252
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.500
 The Objective function. It's just a

253
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:24.900
function

254
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.300
mmm, but

255
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.500
the point here is to either maximize the function or minimize

256
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.400
 the function given some constraints.

257
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.200
So for example, let's say you want to transport.

258
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.200
Or let's use the shipping, you know like in

259
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:42.700
 e-commerce.

260
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:43.600
and

261
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.900
there are some constraints that have to do with petrol consumption.

262
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.800
the distance traveled the weight of the

263
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:52.500
ships

264
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.700
the distance to

265
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.200
the recipients so you have these different constraints and

266
00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:58.700
 you want to

267
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.300
select the parameters.

268
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.600
Such that you're within what we call a feasible region.

269
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.600
I'll show you know, I'll show you an example actually example of this I'll show you both the mathematics

270
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.800
 and the graphical.

271
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.300
Explanation because graphing is

272
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.700
 actually a big part of linear programming especially graphing

273
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.700
 any qualities, which brings me to the I'll

274
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.200
 come back to this slide in a moment. But let

275
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.500
 me just take a let me just jump ahead. I'll come back this basically. This

276
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.800
 is a picture of inequalities, okay.

277
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.100
This is what it takes to this is

278
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.200
 what you would have to encounter.

279
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.800
To be good at linear algebra.

280
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.100
Okay.

281
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.900
Like I said linear algebra is a subset of abstract algebra and abstract

282
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.900
 algebra is a development or develops

283
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.500
 takes the ideas from classical algebra

284
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:51.900
 further.

285
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.900
also part of classical algebra

286
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.500
Is functions and graphing them.

287
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.200
In when it comes to vectors in

288
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.500
 particular.

289
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.700
One technique that we will look at which has applications in.

290
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.100
computer vision and natural language processing by the

291
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:19.900
 way a central

292
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.600
one of the things that we working towards

293
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.000
 as neural networks.

294
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.300
So this is kind of it's also machine learning part of this course machine

295
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.400
 understanding machine learning but no new electric specifically not

296
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.400
 supervise and unsupervised learning.

297
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.300
We'll be working with vectors.

298
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.400
So we want to apply techniques like cosine similarity, which I

299
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.100
 said has applications both in image recognition and NLP.

300
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.800
But prerequisite for understanding Vector operations

301
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.900
 is trigonometry.

302
00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.200
And trigonometry in turn has geometry as a

303
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:54.700
 prerequisite.

304
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.500
what I'm trying to say is this

305
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.800
if you've ever enrolled in a course.

306
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.100
Or picked up a book called linear algebra. It is

307
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.700
 assumed that you know all four of these at

308
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.400
 least the extent.

309
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.600
That would allow you to.

310
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.500
read that book or

311
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.200
complete that course successfully

312
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.000
what I have done in this course is I have

313
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.300
made supplementary material for all four of these

314
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.800
So for example if we come across a word like a vector space.

315
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.100
The word space comes from abstract algebra, and if you

316
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.000
 do not know what that is because you have to know what that is. If you want to make progress.

317
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.900
 Well, then you can refer to this supplementary material.

318
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.100
Which talks about words like spaces?

319
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.900
And the axioms that apply to such a type

320
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.500
 of set a space the type of set.

321
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.300
And of course in order to understand the axioms that apply to those

322
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.000
 sets you need to know some classical algae, but nothing difficult is

323
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.300
 very straightforward. In fact, we can cover

324
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.200
the key Concepts here today

325
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.100
and then there is trigonometry trigonometry is a big deal

326
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.100
 again because of vectors, you know

327
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.700
 must be

328
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.200
I mean, what are the applications of vectors whether it's computer

329
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.400
 vision or even in even PC by the

330
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.000
 way, you just vectors?

331
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.600
If we wanted we want to know how close they

332
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.900
 are to each other.

333
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.700
So we need to understand angles.

334
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.600
The sign and cosine functions and for that we need to understand so basic

335
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.400
 geometry or at least the notation geometry.

336
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.700
This again will be provided.

337
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.000
a supplementary material

338
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.100
Let me come up back up here. So let me this is an example of

339
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.700
 New Year program. Let me give you a pictorial representation.

340
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.200
and then I will take you to

341
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.300
markdown

342
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.600
because through this exercise we will get a sense

343
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.500
 of what systems of linear equations are which is from linear algebra

344
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.100
 and

345
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.900
The objective function which is linear program, so, you know.

346
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.600
We learned two things with one example.

347
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:10.600
We have some.

348
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.500
function that we need to optimize to optimize means to

349
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.500
At least pictorially graph it so that

350
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.100
 it satisfies all of our four constraints. So we

351
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.600
 have these four constraints. So yeah and this function let's particular function

352
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.400
 that we talked about has two variables. Okay. So

353
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.400
 put differently. It's a function of two variables two things

354
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.000
 two variables will affect.

355
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.500
It's maximization or minimization. Let's because

356
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.100
 I know hypothetical example the price

357
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.200
 of a smartphone.

358
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.100
It could be a function of the size of the screen.

359
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.000
and

360
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.200
How much memory it has rather mattress memory?

361
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.500
Or what's another example salary?

362
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.100
It could be a function of how many

363
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.300
 years of experience you have.

364
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.500
And how many years you've spent in in school so academic?

365
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.300
Experience and work experience. Okay, so

366
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.100
 that's salary will be of than we would

367
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.500
 say that salaries a function and it's a function of two things.

368
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.300
Anyway here. We have a function. That is a

369
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.400
Whose valuables are X and Y both X and

370
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.100
 Y Must Be 0.

371
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.700
So if you see here.

372
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.600
If we graph the inequality for X 0 x greater

373
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.900
 than 0 then everything in the right quadrant.

374
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.700
And the first quadrant and the lower quadrant

375
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.200
 would be highlighted.

376
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.400
Okay, so anything that is X anything that is equal

377
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.400
 to or that's an inequality. I hope the pictures

378
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.600
 are very clear, but that's an inequality and it includes zero.

379
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.300
It's a restricting equality. So anything from zero or above

380
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.900
 X will be shaded.

381
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.800
then we have y

382
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.300
must be above 0 right so Y is this vertical axis

383
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.000
 anything about anything from 0 or above will be highlighted?

384
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.400
But now we have two constraints if we take these two constraints together.

385
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:07.500
then

386
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.500
if we just focus on these two then how

387
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.200
 do we satisfy both of these constraints? Well,

388
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.700
the Shaded area must be above

389
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.900
The origin for why?

390
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.200
and

391
00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.500
To the right of X. So in other words we will have this region

392
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:27.900
 that's

393
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.400
We basically slicing.

394
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.500
the Shaded area

395
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.700
But then there's more.

396
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.300
Here we have this other inequality.

397
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.300
2x plus 5 y less than

398
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.400
 or equal to 3,500 which gives us this inequality. This it gives

399
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.000
 us this graph.

400
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.100
So not only does our solution must be in the right quadrant in

401
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.100
 the first quadrant.

402
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.300
We also have this, you know vertical this

403
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.100
 diagonal line cutting through it.

404
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.600
So if we have this coordinate it was also sliced

405
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:57.800
 it from here.

406
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.000
And then there's this fourth quadrant long story short.

407
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.100
we must

408
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.800
perform

409
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.300
arithmetic operations on these two these

410
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.400
constraints which they which are inequalities

411
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.400
and until we find the roots and once we find the roots of

412
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.700
 these equations, we will then have found the feasible region

413
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.300
 of

414
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.200
our objective function

415
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.000
Okay.

416
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.500
So let me show you an example. Let's let's switch to markdown talk

417
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:29.600
 about.

418
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.300
Let's see a system of equation as in.

419
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.600
In practice and that we're matrices come

420
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.000
 into the picture.

421
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.300
So I'm going to slide here.

422
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:43.500
to the right

423
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:45.800
Okay.

424
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.000
so

425
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.700
here is the example.

426
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.300
of systems of equations

427
00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.200
now, let me make sure I have the correct example first.

428
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.900
Okay. Yeah, let's let's do this one first. Let's do the linear programming

429
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.500
 example first. So here we have a linear example

430
00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.800
 linear program example.

431
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.600
Okay, you want to look here on the right?

432
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.700
Okay, I'm gonna type markdown markdown code.

433
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.700
But you look at the right, by the way, if you want to learn about markdown a

434
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.100
 latex, which I'm going to be using you can also go to the

435
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.800
 dashboard. There's a there's some reading material which you can check out.

436
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.000
linear program example

437
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.800
So let's say this is our objective function.

438
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.800
Okay, we want to.

439
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.400
Either maximize or minimize this

440
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.600
 so we want to modify the parameters or

441
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.500
 find out what X and Y must be equal to so that

442
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.400
 this function will give us the maximum value or the minimum value depends

443
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.400
 on the problem. If you try to reduce costs that you

444
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.400
 would want to minimize the function.

445
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.600
If you want to for example increase Revenue, then obviously

446
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.100
 would want to maximize a function.

447
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.200
One notation that you might see is for example.

448
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.000
The cute this would Max that's used before.

449
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.800
the functions name

450
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.300
So you may have seen this.

451
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.500
So this this is maximize the value and then there's something called ARG

452
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:25.600
 Max.

453
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.100
Which means the arguments that maximize the function?

454
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:30.800
Okay.

455
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.900
So we want to maximize this function.

456
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.200
And these are the constraints that we have.

457
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:42.300
Okay.

458
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.200
We have this inequality.

459
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.900
We have these two inequalities in both X and Y Must Be.

460
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.200
Greater than or equal to 0 greater than equal to 0.

461
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:53.500
 Yes.

462
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.100
Now the way we solve this.

463
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.000
The way we can the way we deal with.

464
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.900
These inequalities as we must solve them.

465
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.600
And what we're about to do is very similar to what we will do with systems of

466
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.400
 linear equations and linear programming where we get to something called the

467
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.500
 reduced Echelon form. I'll show you a picture of it in a moment.

468
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.700
So what we do first is we represent the inequalities

469
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.500
 not as inequalities,

470
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.400
 but as equations like so

471
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.200
so

472
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.400
These are the constraints.

473
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.400
as

474
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.200
equations

475
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.000
So these are inequalities.

476
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.100
These are equations. Okay. All we've done is

477
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.500
 we've substituted the inequality with equal sign.

478
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.200
That's and let's label this equation. What an equation

479
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.600
 two. Now, what we want to do again is find the roots of

480
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.700
both of these equations

481
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.000
So we want to know what x is equal to Y is equal and what Y is equal

482
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.100
 to once we find what x and y equal to then we will find a point that we

483
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.400
 could place in the quadrant and one

484
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.800
 of the and irrelevant quadrant.

485
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.000
And by doing that we will have found a feasible region.

486
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.500
So what we will do.

487
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.200
Is we will subtract?

488
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.100
the second equation from the first

489
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:19.800
so we will subtract.

490
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.000
2X

491
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.700
from X Y from Y and 4,000 and

492
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.300
 one 3000 so we will subtract these

493
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:29.500
 together.

494
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:30.800
Okay.

495
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.700
And what does that give us?

496
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.500
It gives us x equals to 1,000. Why because well if you subtract y

497
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.300
 from y y is eliminated 2x minus

498
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.500
 X, that's just X and 4,000 minus three thousand. That's just

499
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.900
 1000 again. This is classic eligible.

500
00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.700
 If you remember this is why you said they're pretty regular for linear

501
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.300
 algebra is classical algebra. This

502
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:55.900
 is just you know,

503
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.200
Adding on both sides subtracting both sides moving terms

504
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.300
 to the other side of the equation.

505
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.500
Okay, so if you know these then

506
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.700
the linear programming and linear algebra are within your grasp.

507
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.000
Okay. So now we have found the first.

508
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.600
Root, we found the first variable X must be equal to 1000. Well,

509
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.100
 now we can do is we can plug in X into

510
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.300
 one of these inequalities. So what we will do is we will

511
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.200
 plug in X into equation to

512
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.200
okay, so we will put 1,000 here for

513
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.600
 x and then we will solve for y.

514
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:29.800
And we do that.

515
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.000
We will get the following.

516
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.000
Right. All you can see we've done is

517
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.400
We have plugged in 1004. Excuse me. We've applied

518
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.700
 we'll plug the 1,000 for x.

519
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.700
Actually, yeah for here.

520
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.500
So here have X Plus y equals 3,000 now we have 1,000 plus

521
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.500
 y equals 3,000.

522
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.900
Now that we just solve for y which gives us.

523
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:55.800
2000

524
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.800
now what we have done is we found.

525
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.900
Y as well, so we have the points.

526
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.700
X and Y

527
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.600
and what are these points equal to?

528
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.300
X is 1000

529
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.400
and Y is 2,000.

530
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:22.600
Okay.

531
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.100
Now if I were to show you a picture of this.

532
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.400
Feasible region it will look.

533
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.200
Like so let me actually put the picture

534
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.300
 on Google Drive. So give me a second to pull it up.

535
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.400
Okay. So by the way, this is how we will how

536
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.800
 we will do the class. I will use markdown.

537
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.300
I'll use marked out and during these session. We will

538
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.700
 also do we will Implement these in Python?

539
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.200
So let me download the picture because it is actually rotated in

540
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.100
 the wrong direction. Let's download this thing.

541
00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.900
I can show you the plot.

542
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.700
And let's rotate it.

543
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.600
There we go. There are the points. So that

544
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.900
 is our first constraint that is our second constraint. We

545
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.900
 use we perform arithmetic

546
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.000
 operation on both of them. We see in this case. All we did

547
00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.900
 was subtract now practice.

548
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.400
You're you're gonna you're gonna have more than two constraints and

549
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.300
 you're going to do a lot more.

550
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.100
row operations

551
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.300
something in linearity. I'll cut this in moment. But as you can see once we have

552
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.200
 found the point once we have found the roots, we now

553
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.100
 have or are able to plot the feasible region.

554
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.600
So as long as the parameters.

555
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.300
Are within this feasible region then our objective function is

556
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.000
 optimized.

557
00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.400
And again optimization means that the function will give us maximum.

558
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.700
Results or minimum results depending on what we're trying to do.

559
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.400
This is essentially what linear programming is.

560
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.900
Okay. Now obviously this is a very simple example, there's more something that

561
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.300
 we've also cover in this code is called a Simplex algorithm.

562
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.600
And if you learn linear

563
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.600
 program within you can even attach something called nonlinear programming

564
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.700
 where you're constraints are not linear,

565
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.400
 so they are polynomials.

566
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:20.500
Okay.

567
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.300
There's a that was a simple example now.

568
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.300
Let's see how this relates to linear algebra. Let me open another tab

569
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.400
 here. This is an example in linear

570
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:33.800
 algebra.

571
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.600
So if we take a

572
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.100
sequence of equations that are set of equations like so

573
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.800
again, you want to look here right in this panel.

574
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.500
maybe activated

575
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.700
here again we have

576
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.300
A set of linear equations I can

577
00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.400
 how do we know it's linear all of the variables or I

578
00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.500
 should say. None of the variables are

579
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.900
to the power of two or above everything is to the power of one.

580
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.900
That's why it's called linear produces a line if there was a square or

581
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.700
if it was square or cube, then we would

582
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.000
 we looking at curves.

583
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.400
What we do a linear algebra is we take all

584
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.200
 of these terms both from the left and rights of

585
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:23.800
 the equation.

586
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.400
and who isolate the constants like so

587
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.800
so we take two.

588
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.900
And one and one from XYZ respectively,

589
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.900
 so that's what we get here.

590
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.100
and then of course the fourth column

591
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:40.300
is a

592
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.800
the value of the rights of the equation

593
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.100
the way we would solve this equation first

594
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.500
 of all to solve it means to

595
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.200
Your solution I don't I don't have time to

596
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.300
 do the solution but essentially you must have

597
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.300
I have to show I have to show a picture but what we

598
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.000
 do is we have the essentially find the roots. We have to find out what x is equal to

599
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:09.500
 what Y is equal to what Z is equal to.

600
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.500
By eliminating these constants like we

601
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.700
 did in the linear program example.

602
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.100
Okay, so let me show you a picture on Google

603
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.400
 because I didn't have one ready here.

604
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.500
I'm gonna type in reduced row Echelon form.

605
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.100
It will look something like that's fine I could

606
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:31.300
 picture.

607
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.700
Let's see. This is a good one.

608
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.200
This is an example. So this is applications both in.

609
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600
linear programming

610
00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.400
And by extension, it has applications and

611
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.900
 economics in finance and transportation

612
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.300
 or Logistics.

613
00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.700
And so look at what we've done here again, we've we're using row operations.

614
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.700
 So we for example add one equation to

615
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.400
 the other equation or we multiply one equation to

616
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.400
 another equation or a multiply one equation with some

617
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.500
 number and then add it to another equation.

618
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.300
If you do this by hand, it is very cumbersome.

619
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.500
Okay, the linear example, I still linear

620
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.200
 program example actually was very trivial it was we only had two

621
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.400
 examples here. We have three and even in this case you have to do a

622
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.800
 lot of addition subtraction multiplication to eventually find the

623
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.100
 route. So here are the roots X is equal to 2 Y is equal to negative 1

624
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.200
 is equal to 3 and it's called the reduced row Echelon

625
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:34.900
 form because look here.

626
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.200
all what happens is that in order

627
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.400
 to know that you've actually found the solution

628
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.500
 or the roots for all three equations

629
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.300
 or the roots for all of these variables is you get

630
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.600
 this form you get this diagonal form you

631
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.400
 can you see how we have why excuse me one across

632
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.500
 the principle diagonal

633
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.000
When your Matrix looks like this, let me

634
00:31:59.400 --> 00:31:59.500
 zoom in.

635
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.300
When your Matrix looks like this or you have one in

636
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.500
 the first row and zero zero then one in

637
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.200
 the second row in the middle.

638
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.600
This diagonal basically, once your Matrix looks like that you can

639
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.700
 then substitute the values back into your equation. So for

640
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.300
 example X Phase 1 to become zero

641
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.000
 three becomes zero.

642
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.100
And now it becomes two. This is how you

643
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.400
 would what have found the roots of your

644
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.400
a roots of these of all three equations

645
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.000
And again I said this is important. Why because let's say

646
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.200
 you have multiple models.

647
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.800
again Financial modeling, for example

648
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.500
If we said that a model is supposed to be representation not

649
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.900
 necessarily technical precise representation,

650
00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.100
 but representation on the less.

651
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.300
So models which have come the form of equations

652
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.400
 most of the time if you were to find the roots

653
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.600
 of those equations, then you would have understood why

654
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.200
 this model behaves a certain way.

655
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:57.800
Okay.

656
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.600
The the the model the equation

657
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.800
 for force is one example Force equals mass times acceleration,

658
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.300
 okay.

659
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.400
So if you're able to find the roots, then you can get to the essence of

660
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.100
 the model and then you can use that to for regression

661
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.300
 and machine learning.

662
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.400
okay, so the real world you actually have

663
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.300
You have to handle multiple models at the

664
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.300
 same time and linear algebra gives us techniques for

665
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.100
 that. Now I said earlier that this is very

666
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.500
 cumbersome to like you have to do a lot of manual arithmetic which brings

667
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.600
 us to python.

668
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.500
with python we can't solve systems

669
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:36.600
 of

670
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.400
linear equations like this

671
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.000
almost instantaneously

672
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.100
so we don't have to do this by hand, but

673
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.900
 we still want to have the capability to do it.

674
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.400
So what we will do is we can we can do linear programming.

675
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:52.200
in

676
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:55.800
you know a large.

677
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.600
sets of equations on large sets of constraints

678
00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.200
with a library like numpy.

679
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.900
Okay. Anyway, this was supposed to give you a glimpse into.

680
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.700
the first part of

681
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.300
the first let's say have of linear algebra, which

682
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:14.500
 I said.

683
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.500
Is systems of linear equations, then there are the Matrix operations

684
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.200
 that we're going to look at.

685
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.600
For this we have to talk a little bit about abstract algebra,

686
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.000
 which you will in a second.

687
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.200
But we also need to know the different types of Matrix. So these are

688
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.500
 the types of matrices that we're going to look at one type

689
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.400
 in types of matrices.

690
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.600
Types, here we go types of Matrix.

691
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.000
And these are some of the types of matrices.

692
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.400
now if you are going to learn machine learning

693
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.300
and this is not all of the types of matrices, but there are matrices

694
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:50.500
 in the

695
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.300
for complex numbers as well. But anyway if you

696
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:54.600
 want to

697
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.600
If how many of you by the way attended the ml papers

698
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.500
 session?

699
00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.000
last week

700
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.200
if you were here for the ml papers episode 1 please type in why

701
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.200
 I just want I just want to check something happen one. Otherwise type in

702
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:11.400
 n

703
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.600
Okay, okay a few people were here anyway

704
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.600
 in that in that episode. I was

705
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.800
 going through one particular.

706
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.000
paper one influential paper or machine learning

707
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:29.400
and

708
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.200
for that example, if you go watch the video or if you read that paper and

709
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.100
 for other examples that we're going to look at in the second episode.

710
00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.300
We're going to use.

711
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:44.800
terms

712
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.500
and when you hear those terms like if I say a diagonal

713
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.700
 matrix, you must be able to visualize it.

714
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.600
Okay, and this is true for

715
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.600
Any any literature on

716
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.600
 neural networks, as you know, neural networks

717
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.500
 are perhaps the most.

718
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.500
Let's say versatile.

719
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.800
Form of machine learning because we can use new networks for regression for

720
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.500
 classification for clustering. What have

721
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:18.600
 you

722
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.100
And really to truly understand

723
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.200
 how deep learning works and then implement.

724
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.100
Those new networks in something like tensorflow or

725
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.300
 Pi torch. You must know the types of matrices. We

726
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.200
 have a linear algebra.

727
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.600
And why you would use one of the other so for example the unit Matrix

728
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.500
 or something called the identity Matrix

729
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.300
 these Matrix allow you to change just swap the

730
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:43.800
 order of the values in The Matrix.

731
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.300
Let me show you an example. Let me show you let me come back to the starting to

732
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.900
 tell you why you would want to know the different types of matrices.

733
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:53.800
Okay.

734
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.200
So if you remember maybe you don't know. But anyway, this is an this is

735
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.700
 a slide. I borrowed from ml episode elbow papers

736
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.000
 episode 1.

737
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.000
so

738
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.700
let's say we have this picture.

739
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.800
It's very blurry picture.

740
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:17.900
and

741
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.300
we want to train a machine learning model a deep

742
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:22.900
 learning model.

743
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:24.100
to

744
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.400
predict what's in this picture the classify the

745
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.000
 object in it?

746
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:32.400
well

747
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.800
Machines, do not understand what pictures are machines only understand numerical

748
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.900
 quantities. Now we can

749
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.400
 do that because right now we're looking at a black and

750
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:43.600
 white.

751
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.200
Picture so it's one channel.

752
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:47.700
and

753
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.100
in one in this black and white Channel what we have

754
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.300
 are pixels.

755
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.200
These pixels are associated with numbers. What are those

756
00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.100
 numbers the range from 0 to 255?

757
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.300
where 0 is a perfectly black pixel

758
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.900
and 255 is a perfectly white pixel.

759
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.100
Now you probably can't see the numbers on this.

760
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:12.800
here, but

761
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.600
you should see that this is the number 10 number 11 number six be there

762
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.300
 very dark pixels and here on the

763
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.600
 forehead. You know, we have numbers that are 200 above

764
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.500
 237 Etc.

765
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.000
Okay, and if we just look at the numbers alone once again,

766
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.700
 you can see we have a matrix of numbers.

767
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.800
Oh what these numbers represent or the intensities of the pictures? Okay.

768
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.000
now

769
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.100
in order for us to

770
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.500
find the weights.

771
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.600
of

772
00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.700
the features of a picture

773
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.300
we need to use different filters filters are matrices that

774
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.400
 emphasize different.

775
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.400
patterns in the picture

776
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.500
Let me show you an example.

777
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.300
If you see here we have the picture

778
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.000
 of the number four.

779
00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.500
Okay, so it's a picture that has

780
00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.500
it's either black or white.

781
00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.400
So they're no Shades of Gray. So here the pixel 0

782
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.800
 represent black at the pixels one represent quite

783
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.300
 pixels, by the way, what we would do when before we

784
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.000
 are ever do machine.

785
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.800
Learning for image is we normalize the pixels to normalize

786
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.000
 the musical from 0 to 1.

787
00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.600
So here one is a white pixel.

788
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.700
now in order for us to to you know for the

789
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.400
 mission to see so to speak what we

790
00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.400
to see the features of this picture

791
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.300
we have to we have different angles to look at we have

792
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.600
 the vertical lines. We have the horizontal lines. We have the diagonal lines.

793
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.500
So here we see it says here apply filter. The filter is

794
00:39:59.500 --> 00:39:59.900
 the Matrix.

795
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.800
in this Matrix

796
00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:03.400
We will.

797
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.300
Put once in certain cells and zeros and

798
00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:11.400
 other cells to highlight or to extract

799
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.600
 different parts of the picture.

800
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.200
So for example here.

801
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.300
I can show you a

802
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.300
the different types of combinations. There's a very nice

803
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.700
 web page that

804
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.700
allows you to in real time. See what different

805
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.200
 kernels do to a matrix that represents the

806
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:29.400
 picture.

807
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.500
But there is one filter that we will apply that will extract the contents

808
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.200
 of the vertical line. So it will go it will only look at the vertical lines

809
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:36.600
 of the picture.

810
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.000
As you can see here.

811
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.700
This filter was able to extract.

812
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.300
the left vertical line of the number four

813
00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.200
 and the right vertical line of the number four

814
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.300
But then we have another filter which is again a

815
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.000
 matrix that will highlight the mid section of The Matrix.

816
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:58.300
So you can see was able to spot the vertical line.

817
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.400
So the horizontal line security so we have the vertical lines now.

818
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.000
and the horizontal line

819
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.100
and that diagonal allowed the diagonal is not

820
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.400
 really special in this Matrix. So

821
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.800
the signals are not as strong.

822
00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.300
But what we that's the idea here, we will we have

823
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:21.500
 can have different filters. It doesn't have to be three can be 20 30

824
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.300
 60 or whatever and we can use different filters to

825
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:24.800
 extract different.

826
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.100
features from the picture

827
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.700
hopefully you kind of appreciated necessity of

828
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.900
Matrices, let me actually take you to the blog.

829
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.200
Hopefully I can pull up pull up the picture. But in the

830
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.600
 meantime look at this and I'll while I pull up that what I

831
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.100
 put up that blog.

832
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.100
so picture

833
00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.000
now by the way when you look up

834
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.900
Some sort of article or video on new networks. This is the kind of diagram you

835
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.000
 would see.

836
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.200
Or here's another one. This is for

837
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.500
Image this is for image recognition.

838
00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.900
So you go from Matrix or

839
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.900
a tensor of matrices

840
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.400
to eventually a vector

841
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:16.300
Okay. So again in order for you to really understand how a

842
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.600
 new Networks net new little works. You must first understand the

843
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.000
 types of matrices. What are the use cases? And then

844
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.500
 how you would apply arithmetic operations on those matrices? Here's

845
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:25.700
 another one.

846
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.200
This is for a secret information. So if you do if

847
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.100
 you're interested in Time series for finance.

848
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.000
or

849
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.400
any any sequential type of data for let's say

850
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.300
voice to speech or speech to text

851
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.600
Again, you would see diagrams like these but these are actually nothing more

852
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.800
 than Matrix operations. So here's an equation. For example.

853
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.100
See if you can make out what these characters are by the way

854
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.100
 mathematically speaking. This is a neural network.

855
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.400
It's expressed with these terms.

856
00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.300
You'll have a look at that try to figure out what this equation is trying

857
00:42:59.300 --> 00:42:59.400
 to do.

858
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.100
Or what I try to communicate. Well, I while I pull up the block for you,

859
00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:03.700
 so

860
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.700
Let me open up my slides.

861
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:12.700
kernel

862
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.300
image

863
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:19.500
block

864
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.000
If I don't find it, we'll just move to abstract also, because we want to talk about

865
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:23.300
 that.

866
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.000
Oh, look at that lucky day. I was able to

867
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.100
 find here. Let's look at this.

868
00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.700
So here this is an actual picture.

869
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.200
And so what you see here on the right?

870
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.500
If I move my mouse, that's the actual picture.

871
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:43.500
Yeah.

872
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.700
And this is the Matrix representation. So

873
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.400
 the intensity of the white pixel.

874
00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.900
If I pick somewhere here on the chin.

875
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.600
You could see a number closer to 255. I

876
00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.800
 hope you can see it's just two one six.

877
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:00.500
There we go.

878
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.300
Okay, and where we have a black pixel we get

879
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.900
 numbers that approach 0?

880
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.600
so which is like

881
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.400
the Shadow on his neck.

882
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.100
now

883
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.000
this is what a kernel is.

884
00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.800
a kernel or also synonymously used

885
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.200
the word filters also used to we will

886
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.500
 use kernel and filter interchangeably both of them are matrices. So if

887
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:26.800
 you see here

888
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.000
On in this Matrix. This is a sharpening kernel.

889
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.600
So if you want to for example sharpen the picture.

890
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.600
you can set up the curl like so we have

891
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.800
That I have to be careful with my mouse.

892
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.300
So you can see we have zero negative 1 0.

893
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.200
And then 0 negative 1 0 and then five in

894
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.300
 the middle.

895
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.400
And what we do what this kind of will do is do you

896
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.400
 see this red grid?

897
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.600
That is that filter it is going to apply.

898
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.300
But we're going to basically multiply the numbers in

899
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.200
 the kernel with segments or

900
00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.500
 we say super pixel of the picture and we

901
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.000
 go stride by stride. Again. This is a term you

902
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.500
 wake up across a new networks we go stride by

903
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.600
 stride applying this kernel basically multiplying the

904
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.900
 numbers again like from Once there

905
00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.000
 are pixel to the next Super pixel.

906
00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.100
And then by the time we're done by the time we get to the bottom

907
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:26.400
 of this.

908
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.600
Matrix multiplying multiplying multiplying multiply

909
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:30.900
 multiply

910
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.200
we would have done produced this picture.

911
00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.100
Now that the picture is sharpened.

912
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.300
It is very clear where the eyes are where the

913
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.700
 nose and what the outline of the faces.

914
00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.600
This makes it easier. If you try to do something about Optical record

915
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.300
 Optical calculator and the pictures are

916
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.400
 blurry or there's a lot of or there's not enough contrast.

917
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.600
Or if you're trying to do facial recognition, you can pre-process the

918
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:54.800
 picture.

919
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.200
but if you want to know how to preprocess the

920
00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.400
 picture and there's a I don't know a book on machine learning that

921
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.400
 gives you the formula, but you cannot and if you're

922
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.500
 not able to read the formula if you're not able to understand what

923
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.000
Linear algebra technique you're applying then we will not be able

924
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.600
 to put implement this in a python.

925
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.300
Here's an experience that I've had and I'm sure others have

926
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:16.600
 as well.

927
00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:17.700
you

928
00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.300
You find a notebook a Jupiter Notebook

929
00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.300
 on tensorflow or pytorch.

930
00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.200
And you want to adjust it for your problem. You want to adjust it for

931
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:29.700
 your own data?

932
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.200
You may not know I'm assuming okay. Let's say not every now some

933
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.300
 of you may notice but most people do not know what a convolution

934
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.100
 layer is.

935
00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.100
Do not know. What our kernel Matrix is or what our filter

936
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.300
 Matrix is do not know. What kind of evolution is to begin

937
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.000
 with a convolution is a special type of Matrix operation.

938
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:53.400
So if you do not know what a convolution is this type of operation.

939
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.000
That you apply to two matrices of different dimensions.

940
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.300
What we're gonna end up doing you're gonna end up playing around with a

941
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.500
 goal going back and forth running the notebook from scratch. Hoping

942
00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.800
 to see a different result. That's not going to get you anywhere.

943
00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.400
But if you understand the mathematics.

944
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.400
what a convolution is like in actually like

945
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.600
the mathematical operation convolution is the different

946
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.200
 types of matrices. Well, then when any time you come across

947
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.400
 a paper like an archive?

948
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.600
You can Implement a python.

949
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.300
And that's really what we want to do. We want to learn to do in this

950
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.000
 in this course.

951
00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.000
how to go from math

952
00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:31.700
to python

953
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.200
to solve a real world problem

954
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.300
and we will look at examples like I said in economics and

955
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.900
 finance and neural networks.

956
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.600
So hopefully understood one.

957
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.400
Reason why you want to look at? Why do you want to understand? Learn

958
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.000
 the types of matrices then? Of course you have different types of

959
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.200
You know.

960
00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.500
types of matrices for example we have the blur

961
00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:57.700
you can see the numbers are closer to each other.

962
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.100
So if you want to Watermark something or blur something,

963
00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.400
 let's say in a video.

964
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.700
Then you would you'd have to look at the way you

965
00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.500
 would set up the kernel Matrix.

966
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.000
Okay, so that's another example.

967
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:15.700
Okay.

968
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.700
How many of you recognized?

969
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.000
the

970
00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.800
the symbols at least in the first equation

971
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.900
like you have a sense of what this equation is.

972
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.500
involves

973
00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.700
If you kind of understand what the equation is doing.

974
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.500
I'll give you a hint. By the way, the the five function

975
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.400
 here is the activation function and your network.

976
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.200
If you know what this equation is, just the first one type in

977
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.500
 y. Otherwise type in in the chat.

978
00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.200
Ron says yes Allison says, yes, Rich.

979
00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.400
Eleanor says yes.

980
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.800
I'm gonna guess we have a 50/50 split.

981
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.000
Yeah, so more or less. It's more or less

982
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:15.900
 50/50.

983
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:16.800
so

984
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.300
the vertical bar above H. That's

985
00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.000
 just the mean average.

986
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.300
The activation function is

987
00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.900
well, I can stand for different types of

988
00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.500
either linear or nonlinear functions.

989
00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.600
 I don't have a picture to show you but the W is

990
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.200
 definitely a matrix.

991
00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.800
and it's super script t means

992
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.700
the transpose of the Matrix so Russia's hypothesis

993
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.700
 sub 1

994
00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.300
what do you mean by hypothesis?

995
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.000
No, actually the H stands for hidden layer.

996
00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.100
So hit the first hidden layer.

997
00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.500
Is given by The Matrix of the the

998
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:01.900
 transpose of the Matrix one?

999
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.700
multiplied by

1000
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.800
the scalar value X which is the mean average. Anyway, the point

1001
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.800
 of trying to make is that we want to enroll in

1002
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.800
 this course and completely expose ourself to

1003
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.300
 mathematics.

1004
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.300
Explore is the meaning of Acts exactly, but that's from statistics.

1005
00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:22.200
Okay.

1006
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.000
now

1007
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.400
let's let me show you a few things that you might encounter and

1008
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.100
 then how you can go about making sense of them. So this is

1009
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.100
 what I try to expose it some abstract algebra.

1010
00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:43.800
Gilbert Strang anyone would have Gilbert's trying Gilbert Strang

1011
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.900
 is Professor MIT who has authored several

1012
00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.100
 very

1013
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.500
Influential books both are linear

1014
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:54.000
 algebra and application of lineage. So one of the

1015
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.700
 books that he's written. It's called the linear algebra.

1016
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.900
And deep learning or something that I affect.

1017
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.500
And learning from data is the one.

1018
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.600
This book is excellent.

1019
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:11.900
if you want

1020
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.300
to become better at Deep learning

1021
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.500
The challenge is this linearity Pro book assumes.

1022
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:21.600
professions in the new algebra

1023
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.300
Eleanor says I have this book in a highly recommended. So do I

1024
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.900
 I would recommend any book by Gilbert strength.

1025
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.300
He also has YouTube videos

1026
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:31.600
 on.

1027
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.500
Yeah, he has videos on YouTube from MIT open coursework.

1028
00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:39.400
 And he has this to say he says he there's

1029
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.200
 one video. I think it's about 15 minutes

1030
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.300
 long and he says he talks about

1031
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.800
 the big picture of linear algebra so quickly Google

1032
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.200
 it here.

1033
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.800
Or I think I had these slides from before.

1034
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.300
The Page open from before it's this

1035
00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.500
 one.

1036
00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.000
Yeah, here we go.

1037
00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.500
So he sets up.

1038
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.800
The foundation of linear algebra and it takes it from there.

1039
00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.300
So if I scroll up he talks about

1040
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.300
the four fundamental subspaces

1041
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.000
of linear algebra

1042
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:14.200
and

1043
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.300
he has he describes these four

1044
00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.400
 subspaces the row space the null space.

1045
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.200
and the column space

1046
00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.000
now the word space.

1047
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.200
Phi is an activation function, I'll come

1048
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.500
 I'll open a picture in the Google and the tab and I'll

1049
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.400
 talk about this in a moment.

1050
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.200
I mean, but if you're not familiar with neural networks.

1051
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.800
You might have to cover some.

1052
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.500
Background, but anyway, if that's something that interests you can take the

1053
00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.200
 course. I'll talk about the curriculum in a second.

1054
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.600
Here they would space.

1055
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.000
in mathematics refers to set

1056
00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.200
A set is a space a special

1057
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.900
 type of set to which certain rules apply.

1058
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.300
So for example if I scroll down let me

1059
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:05.900
 show you an example.

1060
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.400
There were okay. So there are actually two things that I

1061
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.500
 want to highlight two things that will cover. One of them is a notation.

1062
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.400
to which you want to be very or you want

1063
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:18.500
 to have

1064
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.600
you want to be?

1065
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.100
You want to pay particular attention to like you need to be

1066
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.000
 able to spot a vector?

1067
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.700
Unity of differentiated Vector from a variable or a

1068
00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:32.900
 matrix from a random variable.

1069
00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.200
And I'll show you what I mean.

1070
00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:39.300
But let me see if there are other references abstract algebra. So

1071
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.500
 then I have a reason to take you and talk about abstract algebra.

1072
00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.200
Let's say maybe is there a vector space in here

1073
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.900
 that I see before Vector space?

1074
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.400
Because if I turn this into a if I

1075
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.700
 start from scratch, it's gonna bore you.

1076
00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.500
There you see we have references to trigonometry.

1077
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.100
Okay, so let's talk about let's talk about let me show let

1078
00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:05.100
 me introduce some notation.

1079
00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.300
Let's talk and then let's do this exercise right

1080
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.900
 or I will show you the the alphabet of linear

1081
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:13.100
 algebra.

1082
00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.400
And then I will bring you back to this document and hopefully you

1083
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.500
 might be able to get a better sense of what this is talking about. So,

1084
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.300
 let me come over here. Let's open a yeah, let me let's add here.

1085
00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.000
 So this is

1086
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.100
this says we said we call this systems if equations

1087
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.800
 systems of

1088
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:31.900
linear equations

1089
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:37.600
but now let's talk about

1090
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.000
the syntax

1091
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:57.300
Now what is a matrix a matrix is a tabular structure

1092
00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.500
 like the one we looked at earlier?

1093
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:00.800
Okay.

1094
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.500
Let me just add a few line breaks here again. You just look at the

1095
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.100
 right panel.

1096
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.500
Don't get distracted by.

1097
00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.700
What's going on behind the curtains now a

1098
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:13.900
 matrix?

1099
00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:18.200
Is primarily represented with an uppercase letter

1100
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.900
 and you want to follow that convention?

1101
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.300
so for example m

1102
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:26.300
The capital letter M is used to denote

1103
00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:26.800
 matrices.

1104
00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.000
But not just capitalization. It also has to be bold.

1105
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.100
like so

1106
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:40.300
Now what if you cannot?

1107
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.300
The problem is you cannot make matrices, you

1108
00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.900
 know when you're doing this by hand you cannot.

1109
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:51.000
Make the font a bold. Okay. So all

1110
00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.400
 the alternatively matrices can also

1111
00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.200
 be represented with two underlines. This is not something

1112
00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.700
 you will see a lot but nonetheless.

1113
00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:01.700
It is it is used so it is

1114
00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:02.900
 indicated by two.

1115
00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.100
underlines

1116
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.700
They're right.

1117
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.100
like that

1118
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.300
So you need to be?

1119
00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.900
careful about this if you see either one of these notations

1120
00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:24.200
They're both referring to matrices.

1121
00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.300
Okay, so if you cannot make it bold, you would draw two lines.

1122
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.400
 Then there's a vector a vector is either one

1123
00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.800
 column or one row.

1124
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.500
And vectors are denoted in two ways as well.

1125
00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.900
Either with the Bold but lowercase letter.

1126
00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:46.300
like so

1127
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.700
So we'll be a sequence of values like two one.

1128
00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.500
one and twelve

1129
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.400
Okay, but again, you cannot

1130
00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:13.800
 make it bold and writing. So more popular convention

1131
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.300
 is to put an arrow over

1132
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.100
 the letter v.

1133
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.300
like so

1134
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:22.100
both of these refer to fees so when you're reading to

1135
00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:24.400
 the text, you must know when you're looking at a

1136
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:30.200
Valuable a regular variable or a vector row

1137
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.000
 Matrix then there's a transpose.

1138
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:36.200
This is the transport the transpose means to turn the row to a

1139
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:36.400
 column.

1140
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.300
Or the column to a row.

1141
00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:40.000
So if you would take V.

1142
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.400
and put superscript t

1143
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.500
What we're doing is we are turning this thing.

1144
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:51.500
Okay.

1145
00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.200
If you put a t over V, then this will go

1146
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.600
 from being a row to being a column.

1147
00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:01.100
So we get something that looks like this.

1148
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.600
Just gonna copy this later code.

1149
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:06.900
and

1150
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.200
what do we have? We have two one.

1151
00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.100
two one

1152
00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.200
one and 12. That's what

1153
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.700
 a transpose is. That's it.

1154
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.300
And of course if you apply transpose again, you'll go

1155
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:26.200
 right back to what you had before.

1156
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.200
The same is true for Matrix. I'm not going to do the code now. But

1157
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.200
 if you if we were to transpose this then two one

1158
00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.600
 one twelve will be on the first column.

1159
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.100
Six five negative three six would be on the second column and you

1160
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:43.800
 get the idea. That's what a transposes.

1161
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:48.500
Let's come back here to look at other notation. So now

1162
00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.600
 you can hopefully see what's going on in.

1163
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:56.300
Gilbert strangs writing he doesn't either make it bold

1164
00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:59.400
 or put to underlines so you have to know from

1165
00:58:59.400 --> 00:58:59.900
 context.

1166
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:02.100
What these letters represent?

1167
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.100
Then we have two vertical bars. What is

1168
00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:08.500
 it? What are these two vertical bars?

1169
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.000
So we have two vertical bars.

1170
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:18.500
And let's put in UV.

1171
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.600
What does this represent anybody know?

1172
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.900
Ron asks, our vectors assumed to be columns. No.

1173
00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.300
You have to read the the writing to

1174
00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.400
 see one of the referring to so up here.

1175
00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.600
Let me see if I can show you an example.

1176
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:44.300
They will say for example column vector or

1177
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:47.500
 row Vector. You have to like read obviously cannot you

1178
00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.300
 cannot always like infer from the equation alone.

1179
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.400
 You must also read the read the writing.

1180
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.300
Here, for example, I said eigenovactive X. So again, I would

1181
00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.700
 I this is not

1182
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:01.700
the best

1183
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.100
Way to represent the vector like you just have to

1184
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.500
 put our on top of order make it bold. But anyway here says

1185
01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.600
 it is the First Column so you would have to read.

1186
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.500
So you from the context you would know if it's a column or a row?

1187
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.200
Exactly them. That's the magnitude of the vector.

1188
01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.800
The magnitude of the vector is the size of it.

1189
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:26.500
Okay.

1190
01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.400
Okay now let me talk about something else.

1191
01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.200
Now, of course, we will go into more depth like we will go

1192
01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.000
 into Matrix operations. We will talk about

1193
01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:40.900
solving

1194
01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.500
and Performing operations on matrices of different dimensions,

1195
01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.100
 but

1196
01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.600
in different in different session

1197
01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.300
So again, hi. We want to start the high level and then gradually will

1198
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:53.700
 make our way.

1199
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:54.400
to

1200
01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.100
born in the topics. So here

1201
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.500
Those vertical bars which sometimes

1202
01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.400
 are represented with.

1203
01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.300
single vertical bars

1204
01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.100
indicate this so we have v as a vector.

1205
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.700
And to know the magnitude of the vector.

1206
01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.200
is to take

1207
01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.100
the I think this is that this is a vector of

1208
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:18.500
 points.

1209
01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.700
But anyway, what we do is we take the component squared.

1210
01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600
and the square root

1211
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.400
and this is why we do you can calculate distance

1212
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.700
 of a point on you play in.

1213
01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.200
or a Cartesian

1214
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:34.900
coordinate

1215
01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:36.600
Okay.

1216
01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.600
So again, the emphasis here is not to solve.

1217
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.200
Problems one by one. I mean that is part of it, but it is actually

1218
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.200
 to put emphasis on the

1219
01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.200
the syntax. So for example, you

1220
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.000
 would know that this is perpendicularity.

1221
01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.500
Well notation that is used both in Geometry trigonometry

1222
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.600
 and here in linear algebra.

1223
01:01:59.100 --> 01:01:59.200
Okay.

1224
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.400
Okay, so let me come back here.

1225
01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.100
And talk about what will be covered in the course.

1226
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:09.900
So here's a dashboard.

1227
01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:14.400
in the first week

1228
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.700
We're going to talk about linear algebra.

1229
01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.600
From historical perspective when I say historical perspective. I

1230
01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.300
 don't mean a history lesson. I really actually mean

1231
01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.700
 going into abstract algebra.

1232
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:30.500
because

1233
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.300
remember we said that we whenever you're learning mathematics, they're always

1234
01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.200
 two problems that you have to talk of all of the syntax.

1235
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.600
The other was a terminology now much of the terminology and

1236
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.200
 linear algebra comes from abstract algebra.

1237
01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.500
So we will have to kind of take a detour

1238
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.800
 to switch the abstract algebra to know what spaces are

1239
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.300
 what sets are what axioms are

1240
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.200
so that we can

1241
01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:57.900
continue

1242
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.500
You know or make better progress on.

1243
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.600
learning linear algebra

1244
01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.400
Okay. So this first module will emphasize let me actually take

1245
01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.200
 you to the lesson plan. So we see things in more detail.

1246
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:16.900
Okay.

1247
01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.600
So this is the first session we've kind of had an overview of both linear algebra

1248
01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.600
 leader programming this the second session will be

1249
01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:26.600
 about

1250
01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.500
we will briefly talk about waste for solving system

1251
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:35.200
 of equations one example with math, but also

1252
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.100
 with python because I said because if you

1253
01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.600
 want to solve some equations by hand, it's really cumbersome. It's not enjoyable.

1254
01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.400
We want to talk briefly talk about graphing equation inequalities, and

1255
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.900
 we want to do this in Python. So

1256
01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.700
You know the library matplotlib.

1257
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.400
We will use math plot lip. So we will have a numpy

1258
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.600
 so we can represent multi-dimensional data

1259
01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.000
 and then we would use mathplotlip to plot graphs.

1260
01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.300
Both the equations any

1261
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.200
 inequalities. So again if you need

1262
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.900
to go deeper into python

1263
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.300
if you're interested in machine learning and you want to know how

1264
01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:15.200
if you want to become better python for their purpose of machine

1265
01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.500
 learning this would be

1266
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.500
You know a good course to take.

1267
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.200
So graphing equations and inequalities. And like I

1268
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.700
 said, we have to go inside abstract algebra to cover

1269
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.200
 some background and then that way we can

1270
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:31.800
 make

1271
01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.800
a better progress with our study

1272
01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.000
in the second and third modules

1273
01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.800
We're going to go deeper into Matrix operations.

1274
01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:47.500
So yes, we will cover linear program. So we'll talk about the Simplex

1275
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.300
 algorithm and we will look at practically examples

1276
01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:53.100
 in economics and

1277
01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.700
 finance. So but this will all be in Python. Okay, there will

1278
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.300
 be the mathematical.

1279
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.200
Expressions you would have to implement in Python.

1280
01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.500
We will talk about yes, the different types of matrices. You

1281
01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:09.400
 will learn about Square matrices diagonal matrices

1282
01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.500
 inverse matrices.

1283
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.500
The ones we just looked at.

1284
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.600
Now why is this one two

1285
01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.200
 or three weeks long? Well because we need to spend time to learn

1286
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.900
 about we want to this two weeks also.

1287
01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.600
Leads up to understanding PCA.

1288
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.000
And if you remember the slides I said we have to cover substantial ground before

1289
01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.800
 we can really get comfortable with PCA.

1290
01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.700
 So if I take you back module two

1291
01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.200
 and three is going to emphasize on these parts.

1292
01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.200
Okay.

1293
01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.200
Again, we will learn the mathematics of these so

1294
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.300
 you will know how to go from a square Matrix to PCA.

1295
01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.400
But you'll also know how to find a principal components with

1296
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.100
 python.

1297
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.800
With numpy you'd actually be able to do that.

1298
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.900
Okay, so it's not pure Theory it's theory and

1299
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.200
 practice. So two weeks spent for

1300
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:01.200
 this.

1301
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.100
Module two or three will be this and of

1302
01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.300
 course applications of PCA.

1303
01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.600
So you will have an example for machine learning.

1304
01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.000
feature engineering not machine feature engineering

1305
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.800
what example or in finance and

1306
01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:20.100
 another example in logistics?

1307
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.500
Okay, then.

1308
01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.200
We will turn our attention in module for

1309
01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:33.200
 the fourth week to machine learning now. Like I

1310
01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.500
 said, it's not going to be about supervised and unsupervised learning but deep learning specifically.

1311
01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.500
So we will talk about neural network those that literally

1312
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.200
 equation. I showed you earlier will know what that equation is. So we

1313
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.400
 will know what activation functions are. We'll know what weights are.

1314
01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.200
We will know what a convolution of a matrix is we will know what

1315
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:53.600
 filters and kernels are and this will be implemented with tensorflow.

1316
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.600
 So the examples if we talk about we see

1317
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.200
 a mathematic representation, but then apply them in

1318
01:06:59.200 --> 01:06:59.500
 tension flow.

1319
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.100
Okay, so if you want to be good attention flow again, this will be

1320
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:06.600
 an ideal course for you. And then we will look at examples of those neural

1321
01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.800
 networks. We will use new networks for

1322
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:10.700
forecasting

1323
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.500
regression so I I did say we want to supervised learning

1324
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.800
 what I mean is we won't look at stuff like linear regression

1325
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.800
 and random photos random Forest

1326
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.200
 regressor.

1327
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:24.200
But we will look use new networks for forecasting numbers

1328
01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.500
 for image recognition and one example

1329
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.300
 would set them analysis. So image recognition

1330
01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.700
 falls under the category of computer vision center analysis comes

1331
01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.300
 under the category of NLP.

1332
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.400
Okay, and there's all some text people. There's some

1333
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.000
 text preprocessing involved because if you

1334
01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.700
 want to do Center analysis, we have to convert words.

1335
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:45.600
to

1336
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.700
Numbers if you remember from our last session ml papers

1337
01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.100
 when we talked about wood vectors, so we will do

1338
01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.100
 that as well in.

1339
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:55.800
and in practice

1340
01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:00.500
But that will be like a couple of days. Okay, so

1341
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.700
 we cannot cover a new networks or the Practical applications

1342
01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.800
 of new networks in one session. Each session

1343
01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.100
 is one and a half so we'll be a few days.

1344
01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.800
Okay, and by the end of this course you

1345
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.100
 would have completed a project.

1346
01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.000
You would have completed project for neural networks.

1347
01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.200
for all three examples

1348
01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.400
and you would have have one other notebook

1349
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:25.900
 for PCA.

1350
01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.000
Now in this course, by the way.

1351
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.100
if you want to get

1352
01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.300
If you want to get a certificate if you want, the certificate

1353
01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.700
 we have to collect everyone's assignments and

1354
01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:39.000
 exercises we have to and that's submit it for

1355
01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.200
 certification. So if you want the certifications, you

1356
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.400
 have to complete the assignments for all four modules.

1357
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.700
And then you would be eligible for the certificate. Okay,

1358
01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.500
 there will be you will there will

1359
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.200
 be grades and you will get feedback. So the way we do

1360
01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.200
 it by the way, if you want to preview if you want to see how one of

1361
01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.100
 the courses are conducted go to the main page of big number.

1362
01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.400
mathematics and programming finished

1363
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.200
a few weeks ago

1364
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.100
so you can just click here. Learn more go to the course.

1365
01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:10.600
and then you can see

1366
01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.500
You know the types of exercises we do.

1367
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.800
the types of assignments you're given and by

1368
01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.000
 the way if you need a

1369
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.400
If you want a introduction to python like you're new to

1370
01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.100
 python or you want to refresher this course has that so

1371
01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:29.300
 there's a complete tutorial on python.

1372
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:35.000
And of course it goes into set theory, so this would be great.

1373
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.500
So, however, if you want you can look at this.

1374
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.100
But if this course interests you go ahead and

1375
01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:41.400
 sign up.

1376
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.600
Just go to the website.

1377
01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:47.500
click on linear mathematics

1378
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.300
sign up with your email and you're through now, obviously the video

1379
01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:51.900
 will be available.

1380
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.000
by tomorrow

1381
01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.300
and I will have some writing materials a

1382
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:00.900
 PDFs attached for these documents.

1383
01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.100
And also here's what we do where we

1384
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.600
 have our discussion. So right now this is the

1385
01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.200
 mathematics programming Channel which we finished.

1386
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.700
Two weeks ago. So what I do is I give exercises during

1387
01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:18.400
 the class and there will be assignments outside outside the

1388
01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.600
 class.

1389
01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.400
So join the join this channel.

1390
01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.600
Go to Slack.

1391
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.600
Join, the linear mathematics for python Channel if you've already signed

1392
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:27.800
 up.

1393
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.900
I noticed like 10 people have signed up on for

1394
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.100
 this course. What I will do is I will manually add you to

1395
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:34.900
 the big number slack Channel.

1396
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.100
But if you haven't done either of those I suggest you

1397
01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:41.300
 sign up now and in you know, just join this

1398
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:41.400
 channel.

1399
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.200
Because the next session will be on Wednesday.

1400
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.700
the second episode

1401
01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:49.500
Okay.

1402
01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.400
Now any questions from anybody about what we covered today or any

1403
01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.300
 questions in general?

1404
01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.800
Is there anything you would have wished to have learned from this

1405
01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.700
 session that we I did not talk about.

1406
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.100
Any questions about the course? Yes. Go ahead, please.

1407
01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.400
Yes, so when is the right time to ask

1408
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.000
 queries and would be the session or at the end

1409
01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:23.900
 of the session?

1410
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.700
So what is the protocol?

1411
01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.500
You mean in the course?

1412
01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.900
In this course here.

1413
01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.200
You ask you can

1414
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.200
 either turn on your mic or you can put the question the chat.

1415
01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.300
So this session is was actually introduction.

1416
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.100
And no no my audible mitel

1417
01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:46.700
 your little time. Not sure. Yeah, I

1418
01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:47.600
 can hear you. Can you hear me?

1419
01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:51.400
He says I can hear you some query is that when is

1420
01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:54.700
 the right time to ask the questions in between

1421
01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.200
 your presentation is? Okay that if something is

1422
01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.500
 not clear then can I unmute and

1423
01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.500
 ask queries or should I wait till the end,

1424
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:06.200
 you know? Okay, you can you can it's a workshop.

1425
01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.500
 So these sessions are Workshop so it's but by

1426
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.200
 the way the way it works is I'm gonna cover some concept then I'm

1427
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:15.100
 gonna get I'm gonna give exercises. So the way I do it

1428
01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.500
Let me show you an example from the other course.

1429
01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:19.800
here for example

1430
01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:23.800
I post an exercise. These are the exercises file.

1431
01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:27.400
And their support you you're supposed to solve so you will be given anywhere between

1432
01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.100
 10 to 20 minutes to solve the exercise and then you have

1433
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.500
 to spend your attachment to me. So at any point of it's

1434
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.000
 not clear you can ask a question turn out the microphone or put in

1435
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.400
 the chat a second like imagine a physical classroom,

1436
01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.300
 right? How would you go about interacting it would be

1437
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:42.500
 just like that.

1438
01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.500
Alright, perfect.

1439
01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.700
Yeah, that's very good.

1440
01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.200
Perfect. Great any other questions?

1441
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.300
about linear algebra linear programming courses

1442
01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.100
Hey, Danny.

1443
01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:58.600
Hi there, Ron.

1444
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.500
Yeah, I had a question about that. Graphic you

1445
01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.700
 pull down from Google.

1446
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.400
Of the Matrix is that it

1447
01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.700
 had a vertical bar in it?

1448
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.000
Really?

1449
01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.700
Yeah, let's see. It was a

1450
01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.200
three by four Matrix. You just grabbed it

1451
01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:20.500
 from Google.

1452
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:25.500
this one

1453
01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.100
mmm

1454
01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.100
similar to that, but it was

1455
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:37.400
Okay, let me see it. It was like

1456
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:41.000
 a four by three Matrix and there was a vertical bar going

1457
01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.200
 down the right side of it.

1458
01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:47.500
Well, I think that was Gilbert strikes document. Let's

1459
01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.500
 see. I could have been that. Yeah history.

1460
01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.000
recently closed

1461
01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.000
I think that's the one.

1462
01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:00.600
this one

1463
01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.900
that's seeing it in there.

1464
01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.200
I thought it was an image that you said you just gonna grab it from

1465
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:13.400
 Google.

1466
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:16.000
but

1467
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:20.300
it wasn't in the slides. No, that's cheated. So no, well, I

1468
01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:24.400
 don't think it was but it is basically it was, you know, the talk

1469
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.900
 on solving linear equations and

1470
01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.800
There you go. Oh, this is the one okay.

1471
01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.600
So does that does that bar? Imply? What does

1472
01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.500
 that imply in the in this case? Does it imply a matrix?

1473
01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.800
 Oh, yeah, you mean this vertical bar? Yeah. Yeah, they're

1474
01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.600
 vertical bar means that these numbers these terms are

1475
01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.700
 the right side of the equation.

1476
01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.900
That's all that's okay. That's all. I mean this Matrix represents

1477
01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.500
 the equations Yeah. So basically

1478
01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.300
 the idea is because why do you have the vertical bar?

1479
01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.900
 Because your attention must be here you want to make these?

1480
01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.200
You want to make the numbers on the diagonal one?

1481
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.800
Everything else that is not a diagonal zero.

1482
01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.800
Okay. Yeah, okay.

1483
01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.800
So it's it's not an implied matrix multiplication of

1484
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.300
 some sort.

1485
01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.500
And it's no no, it's not some predecessor to

1486
01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.000
 direct notation.

1487
01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.100
Say that again. Did you say direct direct notation none of this context? No.

1488
01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:30.200
 Yeah. Okay. So that's it just means they're just

1489
01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.100
 it's just a separation. Yeah. Okay. All

1490
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.700
 right. That's it.

1491
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.400
Uh to ask the one that solved the

1492
01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.300
 matrix by decomposition the one that solved the

1493
01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:43.900
 matrix by decomposition.

1494
01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:48.200
I don't.

1495
01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.900
Just solve The Matrix which one was that? Well, in

1496
01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.800
 in this example, you're showing is this where you you

1497
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.600
 basically go through steps to to convert the

1498
01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.200
left side Matrix to the identity Matrix

1499
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:08.300
No. No, this one is Big. This one is just going

1500
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.500
 back and forth. So let's

1501
01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.500
 see. For example, if you want to make if you

1502
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.700
 want to get rid of this too, you have to either take

1503
01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.400
 this equation or that equation.

1504
01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.100
Add it.

1505
01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.000
to this equation

1506
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.000
or subtracted from this equation or multiply one

1507
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.800
 term.

1508
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.200
With all of these terms in this equation. Let me see if I can be a picture

1509
01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.300
 because I'm just using a lot of words here.

1510
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:39.400
Gaussian elimination basically, that's that's the techniques we're

1511
01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.100
 going to use. Hopefully the picture will

1512
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.000
make it easier.

1513
01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.300
calcium elimination

1514
01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.700
No, I don't like to know quotations too messy.

1515
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.200
Maybe if you can find a gift if you're

1516
01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:06.400
 lucky.

1517
01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:08.800
Sure.

1518
01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.300
If I just find one picture, we'd be

1519
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:37.000
 would be good. Maybe this one.

1520
01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:41.100
Yeah, maybe this one will do. Let's have a

1521
01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:41.500
 look at that one.

1522
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.200
so this one says what interchange the first row and

1523
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.000
 the third row above

1524
01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:50.200
So obviously these would be terms and an equation right? So we have three equations.

1525
01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.000
And interchange the first show in the third one.

1526
01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:58.000
multiply the first row by 1/5

1527
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.200
And so by doing this so for example, if we

1528
01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.300
 multiply the first row.

1529
01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.100
That one up here by 1/5 what we've done is

1530
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.400
 you've successfully made this one.

1531
01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.400
Now what we need to do is continue this way

1532
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.200
 for the other term so here.

1533
01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.300
They've done it for the one down here.

1534
01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:21.400
You kind of get the idea what the ideas

1535
01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.400
 the ideas. Let me see if I can find another picture.

1536
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.300
You have a look at that. Let me see if I can find another picture.

1537
01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:32.300
But again, you're you're doing Matrix operations to

1538
01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.600
Convert the left side into the identity. Then

1539
01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.300
 once you have the identity, you have the roots in that right

1540
01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.500
 column. Yeah, but I will yeah. Yes and you

1541
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.400
 can you can swap rows you can swap columns. You can multiply

1542
01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.600
 rows multiply columns. Yeah, I would say more operations

1543
01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.700
 not Matrix operations because we're not we're not involving aside.

1544
01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.100
 Yeah, I didn't mean

1545
01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:57.500
 to say yeah, it's just more like vector operations on

1546
01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.300
 a matrix. Yeah. This is it. This is when you when you're

1547
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:03.100
 Matrix looks like this. I hope this picture like really gets the idea

1548
01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.600
 across when the Matrix looks like this.

1549
01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.000
So the Stars don't matter. Those are those are

1550
01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:11.400
 what the roots will be equal to but what the Matrix looked

1551
01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:14.500
 like when you have one across the principal diagonal zero elsewhere, you

1552
01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:17.400
 have saw the equations, then you can go back plug in

1553
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.100
 the numbers plug in for this terms and you would

1554
01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.300
 have known what your models are.

1555
01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.700
You would have solved each equation.

1556
01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.600
Now this happens to be that my least favorite part of lean algebra

1557
01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.500
 because the kinds it's arithmetic.

1558
01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.100
So I stick to

1559
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.200
 one example, but for the examples I just find a calculator to do it.

1560
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.400
Okay. Thanks.

1561
01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:44.300
The cost someone else what is the cost of the course the cost of the course?

1562
01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:48.600
And let me also let me also say this about the cost if you

1563
01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.200
 open the by the way you just what

1564
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.300
 you do is you would click on the link.

1565
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.700
And you would find the prices here.

1566
01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.800
So you're able to preview the course?

1567
01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:00.800
for one week

1568
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.000
if you like it you can upgrade to.

1569
01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:04.700
certificate

1570
01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:09.300
so right now the price is 600 but there is scholarship offer.

1571
01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:12.500
 So if if any of you, you know want assistance

1572
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:14.500
 with the payment just send

1573
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:18.400
 an email to support at big number one can give you discount.

1574
01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:19.500
Okay.

1575
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.500
You can of course order the course so you

1576
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.400
 don't apply for the certificate.

1577
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:25.800
but

1578
01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:30.500
you know because of the number of people it's hard to

1579
01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:32.900
give everybody support.

1580
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.100
If you want full support and you want the certificate you can go

1581
01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:37.400
 ahead and upgrade.

1582
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:40.500
Okay.

1583
01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:42.900
Any other questions?

1584
01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.800
All right. Let me ask this. Let me do a survey.

1585
01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.200
About the topics that we covered

1586
01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:50.500
 here today.

1587
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.300
On a scale of 1 to 5 how much of this were you familiar

1588
01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.300
 with? So we're five, you know, you've already seen all

1589
01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.700
 of these. This is nothing new to you and one.

1590
01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:01.900
This is completely new to you.

1591
01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.700
So if I appreciate if you let me know.

1592
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:09.000
If everything is known to you if you've seen this before type in

1593
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:10.200
 five, otherwise type in one.

1594
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:11.700
or someone number between

1595
01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:16.400
Stephanie says three so somewhere in between handcatch. Okay,

1596
01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.600
 so this is not new to at all.

1597
01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.800
3.54

1598
01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:21.600
Okay.

1599
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.600
And one more question how familiar are

1600
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.400
 you with numpy?

1601
01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.600
Again on a scale of five five, you know numpy.

1602
01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.100
in and out and one

1603
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:37.700
you really don't.

1604
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.800
Okay. Now the numbers are changing.

1605
01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:45.200
Okay closer to closer to

1606
01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.700
 one for now pie except for Allen.

1607
01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:49.900
No.

1608
01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:56.000
When it comes to numpy the

1609
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:58.300
 central I have a slide here. Let me actually from a different

1610
01:21:58.300 --> 01:21:59.100
 size. So let me pull it up.

1611
01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.700
Let's talk about numpy.

1612
01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.200
very briefly

1613
01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.600
because I brought it up a couple of times.

1614
01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.000
the central object in the

1615
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:14.700
 numpy

1616
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.900
library is the nde rate.

1617
01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:24.500
The n-dimensional array, I mean that's what a matrix is

1618
01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:26.400
 after. All right. It's a multi-dimensional array.

1619
01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.700
Array is a sequence of values. For example, we can imagine a row

1620
01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:32.600
 in Excel sheet and

1621
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:36.300
a multidimensional array where that

1622
01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:36.500
 could be

1623
01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:39.200
Rosen Columns of data

1624
01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:41.500
so you can represent vectors.

1625
01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.200
matrices and tensors with numb but the numpy

1626
01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.300
library

1627
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.800
now the ND array is an object and it has four.

1628
01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:53.400
attributes

1629
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:55.800
Okay.

1630
01:22:57.900 --> 01:23:00.900
The first attribute is the data that in

1631
01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:01.100
 contains.

1632
01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:05.200
Then we have the D type which tells you the data type of the

1633
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:05.800
 values.

1634
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.200
the shape

1635
01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.200
if you have a matrix.

1636
01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.200
Then we talked about n by m.

1637
01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.300
Matrix if I said tensor then we'll be n by

1638
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:19.300
 m times P for example

1639
01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:23.300
And then there are and then the third attribute this is the

1640
01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:26.900
 strides which is about the number the amount of space this

1641
01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:28.600
 n-dimensional array encompasses.

1642
01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:32.800
So if you're dealing with sports matrices and

1643
01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.200
 a sports sports, make sure there's one is a matrix where

1644
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.800
 we have a lot of zeros. This is something you'd be concerned with.

1645
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:38.900
Okay.

1646
01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.300
And this sparse makes it something you will

1647
01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.000
 encounter when you're doing.

1648
01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.200
NLP if you remember in the last step in the last session we talked about

1649
01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.100
 wood embeddings.

1650
01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.500
This is related to that.

1651
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.400
So what we're going to do is we're going to approach numpy from

1652
01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.300
 the fundamentals. We want to understand thoroughly what this what the objects

1653
01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:00.600
 are.

1654
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.300
And then we will do some basic example, so we will look

1655
01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.200
 at examples where we reshape an array. So a reshape is this so

1656
01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.900
 if you want to produce an end dimensional array, you take

1657
01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.900
 your python list, which is a playlist.

1658
01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:15.700
That will be the argument for the array method.

1659
01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:20.100
And then if you if you type in shape, well, you will know

1660
01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.700
 the number of rows and columns you have in The Matrix.

1661
01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.400
You can use a reshape method.

1662
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:31.000
Now this is the reshape method will take these parameters if we'll

1663
01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:33.000
 take these arguments if you talk about two-dimensional array.

1664
01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.100
But we can use reshape to well go from

1665
01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.200
 a vector to a matrix.

1666
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.000
And of course you can continue doing this if you have a tensor.

1667
01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.500
So we will look at examples of this and one great

1668
01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:49.500
 way to learn numpy is to see to see applications different

1669
01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:50.000
 in statistics.

1670
01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:54.600
so how can we use numpy to get a

1671
01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.100
 correlation Matrix or how to how to go

1672
01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:00.300
 from a covariance matrix to a correlation Matrix how to find

1673
01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:04.300
 the mean value mean average of the values how to find

1674
01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:05.800
 a maximum the minimum

1675
01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:10.500
and the way we will go about learning up Pi is we'll grab an Excel

1676
01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:10.600
 sheet.

1677
01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.200
or a CSV file

1678
01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.200
then Parts it as a

1679
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:16.700
numpy

1680
01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.200
Array, and then we will look at the different attributes and

1681
01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.900
 methods of the numpy array.

1682
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.100
And then once you've kind of learned the fundamentals of

1683
01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:29.800
 numpy, we can then switch to linear algebra and the

1684
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.800
 approach will be the same we've seen here what I will give you some mathematical expressions.

1685
01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:36.600
Then there will be one example where I go from the mathematic expression

1686
01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.200
 to the python implementation and then you

1687
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.700
 will have to go vice versa. You will have to go the other way around.

1688
01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.100
Okay.

1689
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.400
Pankaj wouldn't be possible. Turn the class after the

1690
01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.100
 first week for free.

1691
01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:55.200
Like I guess we could make an exception in

1692
01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.200
 your case, right? So again, I want you

1693
01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.600
 to evaluate evaluate the course.

1694
01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:02.500
So sure why not?

1695
01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:07.100
By the way, after these courses are over the they will

1696
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.800
 be self-paced. But again, they won't be any interactions if you have any questions.

1697
01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.900
It's it's not going to be easy to come to to answer because

1698
01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:17.700
 we would have moved onto a different course.

1699
01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:19.300
Okay.

1700
01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:22.800
So yes.

1701
01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.700
Next session which starts?

1702
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.200
This Wednesday, we're going to go deeper into the

1703
01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:32.500
 mathematics. So we're going to

1704
01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:37.400
Look at an example of system of equations that let me just say this. We

1705
01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:40.200
 haven't done this in today's session and the subsequence session we're going

1706
01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.400
 to do in class exercises.

1707
01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:42.100
So

1708
01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:44.500
you want to be in front of your laptop?

1709
01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.700
if you really want to make the best of

1710
01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.000
the session that starts on Wednesday and the ones that come after

1711
01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.400
you want to do you want to work on the exercise?

1712
01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:56.100
All right.

1713
01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.500
Any comments or questions before wrap up anything? Oh one more

1714
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:06.900
 thing before. I forget in the previous course. What

1715
01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:10.000
 I did is I I put a survey asking for suggestions.

1716
01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:12.300
 So there was some things that would not cover

1717
01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:15.000
 in the course and I asked you know, what would you want

1718
01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:16.500
 us to have covered extra?

1719
01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.200
I want you to think about that go through

1720
01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:20.500
 the material.

1721
01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.800
And see what would have been a nice session

1722
01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.300
 for you to excuse me what we a

1723
01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:32.600
 nice concept for you to learn and then I can add that because this

1724
01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.300
 is based on.

1725
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:36.400
two things

1726
01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:39.300
books on linear algebra

1727
01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.000
books on machine learning

1728
01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.300
And then numpy array.

1729
01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:49.300
So I designed this course so that it makes you

1730
01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:52.500
 or it helps you become competent in all three, but if

1731
01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:55.100
 there's something extra something that interests you that is not

1732
01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:55.200
 covered.

1733
01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.300
Bring it up. You can even post it either slack Channel.

1734
01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:59.500
and I will

1735
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.000
If it's something that is manageable, I will add it as part of

1736
01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:03.600
 the curriculum.

1737
01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:07.300
And a junior. Yes, this session is free. And so well the sessions

1738
01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:07.500
 on

1739
01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.900
Wednesday and Friday, so the one week is is

1740
01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:13.800
 for free.

1741
01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:15.100
Okay.

1742
01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.600
And I will have updates for ML episode

1743
01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:22.200
 2 and wallpapers episode 2 the video is done. It will

1744
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:22.600
 post it.

1745
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.600
In a few hours, if you're missing you can watch that.

1746
01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:27.600
and

1747
01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.000
yeah, I'll put a post on the slack channel

1748
01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:35.300
 for envelope episode 2. Can we get access to the channel? Which

1749
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:36.400
 channel are you referring to chirag?

1750
01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.200
the slack Channel

1751
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.500
let me actually give you the link here.

1752
01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:45.600
Make it simple. So I'm gonna go pick number.

1753
01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:50.500
Invite people here is the link to Slack.

1754
01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:52.600
There we go.

1755
01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:57.700
Okay, everybody.

1756
01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:02.200
Thank you for attending again. I highly encourage you to join

1757
01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:02.600
 the channel.

1758
01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.800
If you have any questions.

1759
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:10.700
I really suggest you put your

1760
01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:12.200
 questions by the way news.

1761
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.000
We're going to be joined by.

1762
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.600
Other instructors in the coming months who are

1763
01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.800
 from Academia.

1764
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:22.100
so

1765
01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.600
join the slack channel so that you know you could

1766
01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.000
 you get to ask questions for not just for me but other

1767
01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:32.100
other experts

1768
01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:33.100
it's

1769
01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:37.300
Interesting things are coming coming up. But anyway, that's it

1770
01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:40.100
 for today's session. Thank everybody. Enjoy the rest of your day, and I'll see you very

1771
01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:41.300
 soon for now. Take care. Bye.
