00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.400
this session will be continuation of the session from

1
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.800
what was it?

2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.000
Wednesday

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.600
But we're going to look at.

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.400
the applications

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.600
of Matrix and Vector operations to

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600
computer graphics

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.800
So if you remember in our last session we

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.200
 started with the vector

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.800
 operations.

10
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.900
Factor addition scalar multiplication

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.500
we talked about the dot product.

12
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.600
I give you some code.

13
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.900
or drawing vectors on

14
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.900
coordinate system really was just mathplotlipinos drawing.

15
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
Lines on onto the onto the

16
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.400
 plot. Well, we will revisit that code in a moment.

17
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.800
We also talked about the polar coordinate system.

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.200
And how we would go from the Cartesian

19
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.400
 coordinate system to the polar quad

20
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.600
 systems if you wanted to for example, move a

21
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.100
 vector.

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.000
from the origin

23
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.100
by some

24
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.300
angle

25
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.400
And you know, we had to we had to talk about going from Cartesian to

26
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400
 Paul according today. We will also go the other way around.

27
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.700
So we're going to continue talking about the vectors.

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.400
and

29
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.600
something called linear transformations

30
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.000
so let me

31
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.800
write down the item, so

32
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.000
review of code

33
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.800
or vector operations

34
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.700
talk about linear transformations

35
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.400
transform

36
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.700
And then the applications.

37
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.600
of

38
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.200
Transformations which geometric transformations

39
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.400
and of course we want to do an exercise because we didn't do any in our

40
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.600
 last session.

41
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.600
But we'll do next exercise and if there's time maybe I'll also, you know,

42
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.200
 go all the way down to trigonometry.

43
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.900
Something that I want to look at.

44
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.200
I think I'll make it an assignment is to

45
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.300
 implement these trigonometric functions with

46
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.800
 python.

47
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.400
So trigonometric function sine cosine tangent

48
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.600
 can be approximated with series.

49
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.800
I'll talk about that later on but those series

50
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.400
 can also be implemented with python and so you can measure the

51
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.300
the ratio of any two lines

52
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.100
to get the angle

53
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.900
of

54
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.400
to get the angle of any line.

55
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.200
Okay, but we'll cop that later on. So it's a good it's a

56
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200
 good way to read not truly understand trigonometric functions because

57
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 you know trigonometry is all over.

58
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.100
linear algebra

59
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.900
And anything you do with?

60
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.500
Vectors and matrices in particular Graphics. Okay,

61
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 let me return to the code here.

62
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.900
So if you recall.

63
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.600
that is if you

64
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.000
were there in the last Workshop because I uploaded the videos.

65
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.600
Only yesterday so you may not have seen this if

66
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.200
 you were not there on Wednesday. But anyway.

67
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.200
this notebook

68
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.700
was for practicing

69
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.600
working with vectors

70
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.400
And visualizing them.

71
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.700
So at the very top of this file, I'm importing math cloudlib

72
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.300
 and numpy.

73
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.600
And that's all we're using in this notebook.

74
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.200
Then we talked about visualizing.

75
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.900
two-dimensional vectors, okay

76
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.000
So here we have.

77
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.100
PLT figure in PLT access

78
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.000
this will allow us to

79
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.000
embed a plot into our notebook.

80
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.900
and the ax object will allow us to

81
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.500
well, you know modify the axis of

82
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.900
 the of the figure.

83
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.100
Here we're setting the limits.

84
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.000
so

85
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.300
for the and so here we have access to

86
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.300
 the two top quadrants quadrant one and

87
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.300
 two.

88
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.700
So X goes from negative 15 to 15. We'll rest for the y-axis. It

89
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.700
 just goes from 0 to 10. We're not going to leave this.

90
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.400
Leave this region.

91
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.000
We have the vector function which will take.

92
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.300
a tuple

93
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.000
doesn't have to be too cool. It could be a list. It just has to

94
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.300
 be a some data structure with two elements.

95
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.800
Where the first element is the X point and obviously

96
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.900
 the second element would be the white point.

97
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.900
And we use the lens linear space method from numpy to

98
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.800
 create space of values.

99
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.900
from

100
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.200
the starting point to the Finish point. So for example,

101
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.600
 here we have vector.

102
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.100
0 5

103
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.100
so this and by the way

104
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.100
 here, we assume that the displacement on the x-axis is

105
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.600
 zero.

106
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.400
so

107
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.400
where the where we started displacement we take zero Steps

108
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.100
 From the x-axis.

109
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.400
And of course here the wide display Smith is also assumed to

110
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.800
 be zero. That's the default value.

111
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.700
so

112
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.500
we don't move from the x-axis, but we move Five Points.

113
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.300
on the y-axis 2 3 4 5

114
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.100
and this function creates 100 points from 0 all the

115
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.600
 way to five.

116
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.200
Okay.

117
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.900
So this vector?

118
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.200
Had we plotted the one like this one this V1.

119
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.100
This V1 vector.

120
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.200
we would get this blue Vector if I

121
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.800
comment out these

122
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.800
The vectors two and three and I run this code again. Let me

123
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.200
run it from the top.

124
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.600
Okay.

125
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.600
So you can see.

126
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.800
We started zero and we stay at zero.

127
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.300
I mean we started we stay with state

128
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.200
 zero but on the y-axis we go all the way up to five.

129
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.800
So for example if I had set

130
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.100
v127

131
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.900
it would go from 0 to 7.

132
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.300
So to the right?

133
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.300
And then five points to the top so we'll get

134
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.400
 this.

135
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.000
You know slanted.

136
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.900
Bacteria, and it will it gets something that looks like.

137
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.100
this

138
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.100
okay.

139
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.400
Now I also learned you don't actually need 100 points

140
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.200
 to draw two lines to draw a line.

141
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.200
I said that you actually need to draw 100 points. But you're

142
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.300
 actually you just need the starting position the starting point and the

143
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:51.600
 endpoint.

144
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.600
So we would need something that looks like this.

145
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.100
You would need.

146
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.300
x sub 1

147
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.500
and y sub 1

148
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.500
come on now.

149
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.500
and except two

150
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.700
So this would be P1.

151
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.200
And this would be P2.

152
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:30.800
Okay.

153
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.900
So we just need these two points.

154
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.300
I've made a hundred. So if I actually bring these down to two.

155
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.500
would have

156
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.200
the

157
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.500
Starting point for one line segment and the ending point.

158
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.300
So I just set these back to two bring these back to two.

159
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.400
It will work just as well. So this is P1 and that's

160
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.200
 P2 and I'm doing this because of what we're about to get

161
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.300
 to later on. So we're going to continue on this code and to

162
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.600
 look at geometric transformations.

163
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:04.800
Okay.

164
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.800
So that's the vector function.

165
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.400
this produces

166
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:11.900
two points

167
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.500
so x sub 1 and x sub 2

168
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.100
and obviously this will produces.

169
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.600
Why someone in y sub 2?

170
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.400
so together

171
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.700
You know, we're going to form a tuples. So this

172
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.200
this first element in this Tuple is going to be x sub

173
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.000
 1 and x sub 2 together.

174
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.900
That's actually going to be a list an array rather.

175
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.200
And this one also what we array, so this will contain why sub

176
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.800
 1 and 1 Step 2.

177
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.100
So column column this will be column that will

178
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.600
 be a column.

179
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.700
Then we have to draw function which will take a vector.

180
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:52.900
basically

181
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.100
this over here now take that Vector OBG just

182
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.300
 refers to the access the ax object

183
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.500
 from math public and then if you want you

184
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.700
 can displace the vector.

185
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.300
And that's just for the color.

186
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:10.900
and here

187
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.000
this is just for extracting the points.

188
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.600
From the vector specifically if you

189
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.300
 have a vector.

190
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.100
And that's your vector. So let me write this

191
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.600
 in math notation your vector for example of these

192
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.500
 1.

193
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.800
And of course we have to use the correct.

194
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.400
mathematical notation you in

195
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.100
this python implementation. You actually going to have the following.

196
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.500
Let me write down the code.

197
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.300
The Matrix

198
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:48.900
you would have

199
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.200
x sub 1

200
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:53.400
and

201
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.400
Y sub 1

202
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.100
x sub 2 and Y sub 2

203
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.000
and B Matrix

204
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.700
Yes, so your vectors are this.

205
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.600
Now when you pass this

206
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.000
 V1 as an argument.

207
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.400
to the GP function you are going to get

208
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.200
these two

209
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.900
these two values so the ending point.

210
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.100
Why because we can use

211
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.700
 the GP function to get points function to perform

212
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.500
 vector addition.

213
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.400
Okay.

214
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.300
So for example here, that's a second vector.

215
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.600
So let's let's make a v the vector

216
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 one will go to the right.

217
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.000
A vector 2 will go.

218
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.400
to the left

219
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.600
typical in the second quadrant

220
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.800
and of course when I say quadrant, this is the first quadrant.

221
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.900
That is a second quadrant.

222
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.400
We draw those two vectors.

223
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.800
There's our V. And of course if we add them together.

224
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.600
To add two vectors, we will take the points of the first vector.

225
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.400
The points of the second Vector add them together in a

226
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:30.900
 third vector.

227
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.100
And then the length of this Vector is obviously the sum of

228
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.200
 these two if we had multiplied it would have been the multiple of

229
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.700
 these two vectors.

230
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.300
So that's two dimensional now for today. We're not

231
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.100
 going to go into 3D not in this session.

232
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.000
but

233
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.400
Very quickly. This code was it's just an adaptation

234
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.000
 of the code above except this one produces.

235
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.700
The Z point so we have three points so R

236
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.400
 to the R3.

237
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.400
Okay, this is a vector over R3.

238
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.400
or an element in in R3

239
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.100
So it's the same functions, this is 3D. This is

240
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.400
 3D. This is 3D and then, you know, can we control vectors Network 3D

241
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.100
 dimensional space? So we're not going to really deal with this today.

242
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.800
and then of course, we looked at cosine similarity

243
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.100
 which

244
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.100
you know, we said it's used to

245
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.600
Which allows us to compare the similarity of two vectors and

246
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.100
 I give you an example with wood vectors.

247
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.000
Right. So the first let's say we have these three word vectors each

248
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.400
 element represents the probability of that word

249
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.900
 belonging to a particular topic.

250
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.500
The topics are t1234 for pets

251
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.300
 mammals anesthesia and building respectively.

252
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.500
So we have these two word vectors.

253
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.400
You can see they're more closely. They're closer to each other than the third

254
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:06.600
 one.

255
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.400
and so we used

256
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.600
we again borrowed the back and draw functions

257
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.600
 from the previous cells.

258
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.200
And I showed you how to calculate the cosine similarity.

259
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.100
So cosine similarity.

260
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.000
Takes two vectors. That's this function takes two vectors.

261
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.000
The numerator we have the dot product.

262
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.300
And the numerator we have the product of their magnitude.

263
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.000
And again to calculate the magnitude.

264
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.100
You square all three or all n elements of

265
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.700
 the vector?

266
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.700
And then you take the square root of their sum.

267
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.500
You will get the angle.

268
00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:58.900
so here

269
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.000
we have three word vectors, correct?

270
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.500
So this is the first and what we and here

271
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.000
 what we choose is to compare.

272
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.700
Word to and War 3 against toward

273
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.500
 one. So we want to compare what it was

274
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.500
 with one dog or cat.

275
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.100
World one was dog. Yeah, so we want to

276
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:20.800
 compare cat.

277
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.300
Which is this red line?

278
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.400
with dog and then building

279
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.100
compared against

280
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:29.400
dog

281
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.100
So when we compared the word Vector of cat against talking

282
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.500
 you see we have a smaller angle.

283
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.800
Whereas for building in dog, we have a bigger angle

284
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.900
 a wider angle.

285
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.600
and that's how we establish the

286
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:44.800
the

287
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.200
similarity

288
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.200
this is used in topic modeling this so if

289
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.100
 you have a document.

290
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.600
And you want to put it under one category you can.

291
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.600
convert it to

292
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.700
you can create three vectors. So we've done we have just done that obviously

293
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.400
 with these three vectors these cannot

294
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400
 be pointed on the plot.

295
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.500
So what we do is we create three vectors.

296
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.500
Like we have done down here.

297
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:22.700
here

298
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.400
this is the vector for word one.

299
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.100
and then the vector for

300
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.200
War Two compared to one and Vector 3

301
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.200
or words three compared to word one.

302
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.100
Up here. What we've done is we've calculate the cosines similarity of

303
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.000
 word one versus word two. So this will give us an angle.

304
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.300
This will give us an angle.

305
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.700
And this will give us the angle of word one versus word three.

306
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.600
Now, of course, this will only works if we plot it on if we had a polar

307
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.500
 coordinate system. We don't have a polar coordinate system.

308
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.300
You have a Cartesian coordinate system. So if we go if you want to go from Polar

309
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:03.800
 to coordinate.

310
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.000
Here's what we do we take the length.

311
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.000
of the

312
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:11.800
of our lines

313
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.400
Which are directors?

314
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.700
multiplied by the sign of the angle

315
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.200
so the sign of the cosine similarity after we calculate cosine similarity

316
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.900
 will get Theta

317
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.500
plug in Theta multiplied by the radius of

318
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.100
 the vector

319
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.900
and that will give us the point on the x-axis.

320
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.900
Take the cosine of that angle multiplied by

321
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.700
 the radius and we'll get the point of the y-axis.

322
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:36.800
So basically

323
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.200
X and Y

324
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.100
Are these points here?

325
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:44.900
Okay.

326
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.800
cosine similarity of board one and four two

327
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.200
Will give us X and Y.

328
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.700
Here for cat. That's this point over here.

329
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.100
I mean all the points by the way start at the origin so we

330
00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.400
 don't need to worry about the first point.

331
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.700
for all three lines

332
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.700
It's 0 0 0 0 so X

333
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.400
 Y zero zero.

334
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.300
But the ending point ending position.

335
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.000
is given by

336
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.600
this formula

337
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.600
where these what is that is the cosine similarity.

338
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:19.900
Okay.

339
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.700
I did talk about giving you another a more

340
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.700
 elaborate example with.

341
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.100
Autocomplete, but I just haven't been able

342
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.600
 to unfortunately.

343
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.500
But I will come back to it.

344
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:33.400
so

345
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.700
This was an application in 2D space.

346
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.200
For cosines there today. We want to look at something called

347
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.000
 linear transformation and its applications in geometry.

348
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.900
And the later on we can extend.

349
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.600
We can go from 2D to Matrix to Matrix

350
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.100
 operation.

351
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.300
so I'm about to give you a very briefly that the

352
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.400
formulation for linear transformation and it

353
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.800
 will come back and look at its applications in.

354
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.400
you know in

355
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.700
geometric transformations of imagery

356
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.200
Okay.

357
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.500
so let me make a copy of this file say as

358
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.000
You know call this.

359
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.400
transformations

360
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.200
And I don't need.

361
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.400
These two cells. So I'm Gonna Keep 2D and I'm gonna lose the

362
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:37.600
 others.

363
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.000
Okay, so linear transformations.

364
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.600
so linear transformation

365
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:09.500
is a function

366
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.300
here we use a here using map notation.

367
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.100
So f is a function that goes from RN to

368
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.500
 RM.

369
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.700
now a linear transformation can take you from

370
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.100
R3 to R3 or

371
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.200
 R3 to R2

372
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.100
so you can actually go from three point to two points or three points to

373
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.700
 3 points you can

374
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.000
Change the transformations.

375
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.100
Now this will a linear transformation holds or

376
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.300
 a linear transformation is a linear transformation if these two conditions

377
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:42.600
 hold.

378
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.500
For example, you have two vectors UV and V.

379
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.600
Then if you take the sum.

380
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.500
of two vectors and remember from abstract from

381
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.200
from tutorial 8

382
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.800
we talked about the following. Let me copy this.

383
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.900
Paste it on top. This is from the other tutorial.

384
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.400
And thank you Richard for correcting me on the scalar multiplication. So

385
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.800
 I confuse scale a multiplication.

386
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.100
I call them matrix multiplication when I was really referring to

387
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.600
 the dot product.

388
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.200
anyway

389
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.300
we said that the sum of two vectors will also be

390
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.800
A third Vector, which means whatever this is, let's

391
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.000
 say we get a vector W that will also be an element

392
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.200
 in V. So it's gonna two vectors give you a

393
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.400
 vector.

394
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.800
A scalar multiplied by Vector gives you a vector.

395
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.300
and the dot product

396
00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:55.100
because and this is how you perform a DOT product just multiply the

397
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.600
 elements of both

398
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.100
 vectors.

399
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.000
Take their sum and you will get the inner product.

400
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.500
We'll also be a vector.

401
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:05.100
so

402
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.400
the sum of the two vectors, which will also be a vector must be

403
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:09.700
 equal to

404
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.400
that transformation

405
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.800
of the

406
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.900
of each vector

407
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.600
separately

408
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.100
I mean exactly what you're seeing here.

409
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.500
This condition must hold for addition. And of course this condition for

410
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.400
 scalar multiplication must hold.

411
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.200
So for me to elaborate, let's consider these two

412
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.600
 examples.

413
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.500
Here we have example one an example. So this is one example.

414
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.700
The comet in the chat. Let me look at the comments.

415
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.100
Did we Define?

416
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.700
Capital italic v as the euclideanian space

417
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.100
Vector space it's a it's it's it's the set of vectors.

418
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.900
V is the set of vectors

419
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.100
Okay.

420
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.800
So here's a here's an example of a transform linear

421
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.100
 transformation.

422
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.500
Okay, no particular reason for using application by

423
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.100
 the way, but let's say this is the lead. So this

424
00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.200
 is map notation. This is function notation.

425
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.100
So is this a we want to see if this is

426
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.300
 a if this is a if this function could be a linear

427
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.400
 transformation for two vectors.

428
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.400
of course, these are two elements of a vector but

429
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.800
it's still applies for vectors as well.

430
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.300
here if we take

431
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.400
and just to avoid confusing the

432
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.600
 variables because it's valuable can

433
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.100
 also stand for the sum of two variables. Let me

434
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.100
 use a different letter here.

435
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.100
for example

436
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.800
I will use let's use U.

437
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.000
Okay.

438
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.300
So, let's see if this is an example if this is if this

439
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.300
 is a lean transformation so you we will replace with X Plus

440
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.300
 Y X Plus y

441
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.000
So this one argument will be you.

442
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.200
Well X Plus y squared so if we

443
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.200
 substitute X Plus Y into U will get X Plus y squared.

444
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.400
Which will give us this.

445
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:38.800
You know.

446
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400
quite Relic expression

447
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.200
now if we take f of x and F of

448
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:48.700
 Y separately

449
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.200
f of x will give us x squared.

450
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.700
So we replace x with u?

451
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.100
And for wide replace you with Y, we'll give

452
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.700
 us x squared plus y squared and clearly this expression

453
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.600
 and that expression are not equivalent.

454
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.300
So this is not a linear transformation.

455
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.400
This is an example of a function. That will be

456
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.400
 a linear transformation.

457
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.500
Well, and how do you prove that? Well, you must evaluate right you

458
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:25.600
 must.

459
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.900
Take X and Y over 2.

460
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.300
And then to take f of x of this value and

461
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.700
 then if y of this value, but anyway if you do the algebra.

462
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.500
You will see that.

463
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.500
They will be equivalent. So what I'm trying to say is this

464
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.500
G of again, I'm going to substitute x

465
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.600
 with u just to avoid any confusion if I

466
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.700
 would take x g of x

467
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.200
Plus y

468
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:57.900
and then we do some algebra.

469
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.400
Dot if you do the algebra, it will turn out that G Plus

470
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:01.600
 X.

471
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.100
plus G Plus y

472
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.100
or equivalent

473
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:10.500
Of course.

474
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.200
Both of these conditions must hold true, okay.

475
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.800
So you have to check for that and check for this.

476
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.000
Let's look at an example of a linear transformation and also

477
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.200
 matrices can be

478
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.900
we can also do linear Transformations on matrices.

479
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.300
So let me also add this comment.

480
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.400
This idea of matrices as linear transformation will come.

481
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.100
And to play once we talk about once we return

482
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.900
 to the topic of systems of linear equations.

483
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.000
and of course computer vision

484
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.200
So our discussion today has applications and finance.

485
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.100
and

486
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.700
computer vision later on

487
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.800
when we get to neural networks.

488
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.200
It was everything by the way a new network is a

489
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:12.300
 matrix.

490
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.400
Everything in neural networks, and neural networks are the

491
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.800
 infrastructure for deep learning.

492
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.700
It's all Matrix operations. We're going to look at we

493
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.400
 we're going to look at a matrix operation

494
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.300
 that we haven't talked about like the chronicle product the convolution.

495
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.400
Which is another way of multiplying two matrices together.

496
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.100
But we'll talk we'll get get it there later on. So here's an example of a matrix.

497
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.400
As linear Transformations, okay.

498
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.800
we have a times X plus b, so imagine we have a

499
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.100
system of linear equations

500
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.200
here B

501
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.000
Is what the equations equal to?

502
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.800
so if you remember from linear program we had

503
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.000
I think 2x plus y equals 4000.

504
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.500
So anything's the right of the right side of the equation would be in

505
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.300
 there in the in the B vector.

506
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.900
Anyway, if you see here, we have two that we have a matrix The

507
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.300
 Matrix a

508
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.700
which is a two by three Matrix and the vector.

509
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.400
Which is well.

510
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.300
Three dimensions. It's we have three dimensions three

511
00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.300
 points multiply this Matrix and we

512
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:25.600
 go from

513
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.000
Three vectors to objective with

514
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.000
 three elements to a vector with with with two elements

515
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.200
 from R3 to R2.

516
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.200
Okay, we will use we will very soon build upon this

517
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:40.400
 to.

518
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.400
And return to it once we look at more elaborate computer

519
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.100
 vision applications.

520
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.800
So today we will work with the vectors.

521
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.700
Later on, we will work with matrices.

522
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.200
And I don't know if we might have time to do this. But if we

523
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.400
 don't do it in live session all add some

524
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.600
Code notebook so you can look at later on for cubes.

525
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.300
for geometric transformations in the in the three-dimensional

526
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.000
 plane

527
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:10.300
Okay.

528
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.100
Let's return to the notebook for transformations.

529
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.000
And let me create a new section here.

530
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.500
Call this linear transformations.

531
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:31.900
Okay, this is

532
00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.700
Three, okay.

533
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.300
So I'm gonna scroll up here and let

534
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.500
 me just yes and math is imported. Just making

535
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.300
 sure everything.

536
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.800
Okay. I'm going to borrow this bit.

537
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:01.900
Close that.

538
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.400
And I'm gonna go from 10.

539
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:28.600
to 10

540
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.300
also on the y axis.

541
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.700
So 0 will be the middle of our plot.

542
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.200
PLT is not defined.

543
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.100
PLT is not defined because I need to run these cells. So

544
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.300
 let me run them all.

545
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.100
Okay, so when we draw

546
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.300
 vectors, we're going to draw it.

547
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:10.600
here in the middle

548
00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.400
Okay, let's look at let me draw another. Let me draw a vector to

549
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.100
 get started with.

550
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.800
Here we have V sub 1 again from before.

551
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.200
Okay, again, I've created this functions

552
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.200
 to obstruct them away. So the origin of this

553
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.000
 Vector will of course be zero.

554
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.400
So if we set this to zero, that means you're going 0

555
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.400
steps from 0 well

556
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.900
That means you're not going to move anywhere on the x-axis or

557
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.900
 you have set it here to four.

558
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.200
And since our origin for the on the wax, it's also

559
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.300
 it's also zero that means four steps up. Anyway,

560
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.700
 you basically you draw a vertical line.

561
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.000
And if I want to draw this Vector, I'm going to go draw.

562
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:55.400
V1

563
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.100
I need to set obj to the ax object.

564
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.900
And there's my line.

565
00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.500
If you want me to make it taller I can just make it

566
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:08.600
 10.

567
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.300
Make it down to wait.

568
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:15.700
Okay.

569
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.000
So let me show you some what are an example of some geometric

570
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.700
 transformations.

571
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.200
And I have a PDF. I want

572
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:28.400
 to show you.

573
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.900
type saved here

574
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.600
Where did I put the PDF?

575
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.200
It's faster than me running it down.

576
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.400
Copy pasting the code.

577
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:41.500
Okay.

578
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.700
Any second now?

579
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.000
This is one but I think I had I think

580
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:32.600
 is the one.

581
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.200
Let me double check.

582
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.000
And I had another one.

583
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.200
Okay, this I'm going to keep yes. So this this I'm going

584
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.300
 to show you but there was another one.

585
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.200
This is from Cornell. This other one is from

586
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.000
I think you see Urban. It's just taking a while to load.

587
00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:04.400
Oh.

588
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.100
yeah, so for example, this is an example of going from

589
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.600
the two-dimensional space to three-dimensional space

590
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.000
 so that this is a linear transformation.

591
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.600
Okay, so if you want to project a plane.

592
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.400
It's in a three-dimensional space. You can do that. Obviously

593
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.600
 this has applications and computer vision.

594
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.600
And computer vision is a subset of machine learning.

595
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.300
These are the conditions we talked about.

596
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.700
Where is the

597
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.500
The transformation that I this is

598
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.000
 the one yes, so here look at this one.

599
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:52.800
Let me show you.

600
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.800
I'm gonna we're gonna go through some of these let me begin with the dish

601
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.800
 for example this year.

602
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.200
This is the sheer transformation.

603
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.400
So for example, if we have in our case, we have a straight line.

604
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.300
 Yes. Now, of course a matrix or I

605
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.300
 should say a plane.

606
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:13.600
is

607
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.100
You can imagine it being a moth a multitude

608
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.700
 of vectors.

609
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.700
I will show you in the code what I mean, but I want to show you how we can

610
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.900
 take these transform these geometric transformation matrices.

611
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.400
to modify

612
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.100
The shape of our vectors so we will start with

613
00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.200
 the vectors later on. We will look at transforming matrices doing exactly what

614
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:35.800
 you're saying here.

615
00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.100
like skewing matrices

616
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.500
you know when you use Photoshop if you ever use Photoshop

617
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.500
You know you can skew.

618
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:47.700
a picture

619
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.700
You know, like if you if you're trying to put you know, someone's head

620
00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.000
 on the body of an elephant, you know.

621
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.300
This is what you're doing. You're doing Matrix Transformations. Okay, so

622
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.700
 let me show you how for example The Matrix tissue. Okay

623
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.200
 here stands for the degree to which you want to skew or

624
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.700
 you want to apply sheer to the play.

625
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.500
I prefer gimp. Oh, of course. You can also use gimp.

626
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.300
Okay. Now I I to me, this is particular interesting because I'm

627
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.100
 trying to create a new network.

628
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.200
or

629
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.700
detecting math symbols

630
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.300
In PDFs in a PDF, you really

631
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.500
 can't just extract text because of the encoding.

632
00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.700
And one problem you have with the math literature.

633
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.400
Is for example, let me show you if I can pull up

634
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.700
 an example. This can be a problem. So relevant

635
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.200
 to take this discussion, but let me know. Let's say you have like a

636
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:52.100
 paragraph of text and then there was a like I

637
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.900
 mention of the variable X.

638
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.600
Now I want to trade the new network to to distinguish

639
00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.000
 between X.

640
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:01.500
You know.

641
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.300
from some English sense

642
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.700
and when it's used

643
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.800
in reference to some variable.

644
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.400
In an equation somewhere in the page.

645
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.400
So you have to be very acutely aware of or the model has to be acutely aware

646
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.300
 of the

647
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.100
How much land there is in the letter?

648
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.300
And of course, yeah, if there's it's on the background of a

649
00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.800
 picture or a background of diagram.

650
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.400
isolated so if computer vision is, you know something that's

651
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.900
 interesting to you if you want to do OCR

652
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.900
If you want to do, you know.

653
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.400
Like in autonomous vehicles being able to detect what's on

654
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.400
 the foreground. What's the background?

655
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.400
You know, this is this is this is relevant. Okay, let's

656
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.900
 begin with the basics. We will eventually get to that point later on.

657
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.000
So let's let me show you how we can

658
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:52.100
 apply.

659
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.400
Shear to this line, okay.

660
00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.300
That's our Vector. I'm going to create here

661
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.300
 a transformation matrix. There are unicodes for

662
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.700
 a math symbol. The problem is when they pick them up.

663
00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.300
No, no Unicode. I actually

664
00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.800
 want to be able to search equations.

665
00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.700
So I need to convert the books.

666
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:17.400
or the

667
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.300
a PDFs eventually will be in the form of

668
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.600
 picture. So I have to do scan those PDF pages.

669
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.400
Like they are pictures and then turn them eventually

670
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.100
 to latex code later code is exactly what you know

671
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.400
 what I use here because with latex code I can index it.

672
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.300
So it basically I'm going to make a search engine for

673
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.200
 books. I would write it Write a math equation expression.

674
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.100
and I'll get

675
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.300
search results. Google actually does this.

676
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.400
Google doesn't impressively well if you want to if you search for a formula

677
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.500
 with in latex code Google will pull up web pages

678
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.000
 and even pages from books.

679
00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.400
There's there's Google books, which is a repository of books and it

680
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.200
 will pull up the page.

681
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.600
Which is pretty pretty cool. So if they've done it, it's certainly doable,

682
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.300
 but obviously, yeah.

683
00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.500
That's closed Source. I'm trying to make it.

684
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.200
Make my own anyway.

685
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.200
So this is our vector.

686
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:17.500
and

687
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.100
if I type it out here we will see.

688
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.500
Okay, I I this is I don't want 100 points.

689
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.000
 If you remember I said we can make it only two points. So let me modify this

690
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.500
 code.

691
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.900
I thought I deleted this little.

692
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.300
delete this

693
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:53.900
delete that.

694
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.100
one more time

695
00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.600
once more click on all

696
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:03.900
yeah.

697
00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.100
so

698
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.300
this is x sub 1 x sub 2.

699
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.400
y sub 1 y sub 2

700
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:14.800
so

701
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.400
X goes from x sub 1 x sub two

702
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.300
 they're all on the same place, but for why we go from

703
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.500
 y sub 1 to Y sub 2 that's

704
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.100
 that's eight.

705
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.800
I'm able to use some grip.

706
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.100
post later

707
00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.400
Yeah, I have no issues with

708
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.300
 the searching the latex part. It's the converting PDF to

709
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.100
 lighting part. That's tricky now. There is something called Matt picks math

710
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.700
 mix is very good.

711
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:42.900
but

712
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.300
first of all, it's closed source and

713
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.400
It doesn't work. When you when you want to scan the full

714
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.200
 PDF page. If you take a snapshot like a

715
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.100
 paragraph within a page, it's fine, but I want to

716
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.000
 scan entire pages of books.

717
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.500
And I want to have a database of 100 books. So the

718
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.700
 great part is fine. It's the going for picture to latex.

719
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.300
But I'm getting close to a solution. I'm getting close to it. And I'm

720
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.600
 going to show you part of the I'm gonna We

721
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.200
 Will We are gonna talk about new light works

722
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.200
 and computer vision in module 4, but let me come

723
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.500
 back here. So

724
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.000
I'm going to multiply this Matrix.

725
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.900
With a transformation matrix, so I'm going to go look at

726
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.400
 my code here.

727
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.900
And let's call this shear.

728
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.400
and this will be a two by two just like

729
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.300
in this presentation from I think

730
00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.300
 this is UC Urban.

731
00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.500
Make sure to give them credit.

732
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.900
Where was this year this year?

733
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:52.800
That's the one.

734
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.300
So I want to go NP

735
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.000
 dot array.

736
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.200
and if you remember from the LED composition session

737
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.300
We said that this is an identity Matrix.

738
00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.000
This says key Pro 1 as is.

739
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.500
And this one says keep row two assets. If I

740
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.300
 had done one here, then we would be multiple.

741
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.600
multiplying or rather adding Row

742
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.200
 1 to R2

743
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.900
if I do this and I multiply

744
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.000
V1 it's called a vector but it's really

745
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.100
 a matrix right because x sub 1 except to Y sub 1

746
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.200
 y sub 2 but anyway, if I multiply these two together if I do if

747
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.000
 I use the mat.

748
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.700
Multiply method. So this is

749
00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.100
 my original vector.

750
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.000
I'm going to say V1.

751
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.600
V1

752
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.100
I think when you apply transformation use apostrophe.

753
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.500
I can't use apostrophe here. So I'm just going to use.

754
00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.300
transform

755
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.200
and this will be NP mode multiply.

756
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.100
So the transformation matrix must come first. So

757
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.100
 Shear times V sub 1

758
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.500
And then I'm going to draw.

759
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.900
the vector after I have

760
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.600
applied some geometric transformation

761
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.300
So the original one stay let's make the original one

762
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:27.800
 black.

763
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.300
C equals black

764
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.900
and the transformation will be red.

765
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.000
C equals red

766
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.800
now I just complaining because

767
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.100
different dimensions different dimensions

768
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.700
yeah, because this has to be

769
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.900
A list this has to be honest.

770
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.700
Let's try that again. One, two three.

771
00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.800
Okay, and yeah, so obviously the red

772
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.400
 is drawn over the black one because this is still an

773
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:02.900
 identity Matrix.

774
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.500
If I want to she read if I want to make it slanted left

775
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.700
 or right I have to change.

776
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:09.800
this element

777
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.300
So let me try to and of

778
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.100
 course we have to keep in mind our access goes and increments of what is

779
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.200
 this 2.5?

780
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.200
So if I wanted to go 2.5 I was gonna

781
00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.900
 make it 2.5. Let's see what that does.

782
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.800
Okay, that's a lot. Let me make it.

783
00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.000
less than that 0 Maybe

784
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600
1.25

785
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.800
Oh, that's still too much.

786
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.400
Let's make it.

787
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.100
about this

788
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.400
Okay, I mean it's still applying here, but I know I don't want

789
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.100
 it to be this extreme.

790
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.900
And of course we can go the negative Direction.

791
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:00.000
Okay.

792
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.100
Let me go whatever is as much smarter number.

793
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.100
How about

794
00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:09.800
what is this?

795
00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:12.500
fine

796
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:15.800
Yeah.

797
00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.800
So imagine you have an object.

798
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.000
Like in the video game and you want to make sure it has a shadow I

799
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.900
 can use a Shear effect.

800
00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.300
Now what if we want to create a plane our plane? Maybe let me borrow

801
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:30.900
 this code again.

802
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.700
Paste it here.

803
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.600
And a matrix is

804
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:42.900
 a

805
00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.100
set of vectors set of row vectors.

806
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.700
So let's say we have the following.

807
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.500
We create a matrix m.

808
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.900
Initially you will be in mpls.

809
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.800
And now let's say we want to give this Matrix.

810
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.300
10 rows

811
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.300
it will be of

812
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.800
a row of

813
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.500
10 10 rows of vectors

814
00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.500
All of them eight which each row would

815
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.300
 be a vector which and will be 8.

816
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:42.600
points

817
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.300
It's like will be eight.

818
00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:48.000
And I'm going to put each row inside the Matrix. So if I run this.

819
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.900
Okay. Oh, no, we're not going to see it just yet. But maybe this is a

820
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.900
if I type an m dot shape.

821
00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.400
Okay, so we have 10 rows.

822
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.400
Two by two well, but this is a this is a list of two dimensions.

823
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.000
This is X and X and Y.

824
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:13.800
Okay.

825
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.900
I'll show you what I mean in a second now if I plot this

826
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.200
 Matrix.

827
00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.100
So I'm going to go.

828
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.100
here

829
00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:28.800
alright

830
00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.200
Let's make this hard or let's make

831
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:37.600
 this V.

832
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.300
for each V in them for each Vector inside the

833
00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.600
 matrix by run this

834
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.800
So you can see here we have ourselves.

835
00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.300
a plane

836
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.000
Okay.

837
00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.500
Now if you wanted to look like a plane

838
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.100
 like we see here.

839
00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.200
I can close it. I can close the displacement. I want to

840
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.700
 call if I close this placement here.

841
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.400
I can make them move in a fractions right now. They're moving

842
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.500
 in increments of I think in one increments of

843
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:09.700
 one.

844
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.600
but if I make this, you know one tenth

845
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:15.900
you can see now.

846
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.200
It's starting to look like a rectangle.

847
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.700
Let me make it a little.

848
00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.600
increase in displacement you can see

849
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.200
let me go from 5 to 100.

850
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:35.900
to increase the width

851
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.100
Okay, maybe maybe.

852
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.300
Increase the space of the more let's go 150.

853
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.300
Yeah.

854
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.500
so now if I apply shoe to this like before

855
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.900
so I'm going to go here.

856
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.900
gonna copy paste this

857
00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.800
copy paste that

858
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.100
and multiply this I'm going to go Ms up.

859
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:08.500
transform

860
00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.600
multiply the sheet or matrix by the original

861
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.100
 Matrix

862
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.400
I run this now.

863
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.600
So that's the original one. But if I say m transform

864
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.100
there we have now applied to the Matrix.

865
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.200
Okay.

866
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.900
So this linear transformation works for either the vector?

867
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.300
and the Matrix so after all Matrix is

868
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:45.600
 just

869
00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.200
you can imagine as a sequence of vectors but not necessarily

870
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.000
 because if you have four points you can we can use the

871
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.200
 fill between method.

872
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.000
To draw a plane. So we plot Four Points.

873
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.500
And then we can draw so maybe I'll show I don't have the code, but I'll I'll write

874
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:03.700
 it down.

875
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:04.700
Okay.

876
00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.400
I want to do an exercise now.

877
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.200
These are pretty straightforward. So if you want to shoot if you know

878
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.300
 if you want to share left you right you can you just have to change this the sign for

879
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.900
 example go from negative to positive and you can

880
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.900
make it slanted to the right.

881
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.000
just like, you know just like we see here and then what if we want

882
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:28.500
You know in this direction, well, we can just make the 0.

883
00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.700
I mean, I think you already get the idea but let's you know.

884
00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.000
I'm showing that side because I want to use that I want you to use that for this

885
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.300
 exercise.

886
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.100
There we go. It's you know, that's just

887
00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.600
 share that direction.

888
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.500
These are pretty straightforward.

889
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.100
If you want to contract expand.

890
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.100
If you want to if you want to widen the Matrix, so

891
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.100
 let's see what this looks like. Go back here. Turn it back

892
00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.600
 into an IDE Matrix and make this.

893
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.000
0.5.

894
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.400
Or let's make it 1.5.

895
00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:14.700
You making it wider.

896
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.600
This we will use this later on we will use this this snippet

897
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.800
 and develop it further.

898
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.400
Okay, let's do an exercise on.

899
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.400
This but I will use the other slide from

900
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:37.700
 Cornell.

901
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.400
for reference

902
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.800
What is that rotation one?

903
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.600
Yes, so let's make this exercise but instead

904
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.400
 of going from an identity Matrix.

905
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.100
For shearing or making it white. Let's

906
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:56.500
 see if we can.

907
00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:01.100
How we can rotate it, so you'll have to combine your knowledge

908
00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.300
 of polar coordinates.

909
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.200
And what we just talked about to accomplish this rotation.

910
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.300
So it will be a simple exercise.

911
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:12.800
I'll give you this code. Of course.

912
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.400
Let me save this as exercise 1.

913
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.700
Sorry, not exercise one we've done how many are how many

914
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.700
 exercises have we done at this point?

915
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.000
We've done.

916
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.200
I thought we did more than one exercise.

917
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.900
I will tentatively call it to

918
00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.400
in this exercise you

919
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.500
You will use this code?

920
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.900
to rotate a vector

921
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:22.900
rotate

922
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:24.700
the vector

923
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:28.900
v sub 1

924
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.900
by 45 degrees

925
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:34.700
90 degrees

926
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:41.900
so this is for your plot.

927
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.100
and

928
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.500
create a vector.

929
00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.500
So this is a line segment. It will go from

930
00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.200
0 0

931
00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:27.200
2

932
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.300
0 10

933
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:36.900
okay.

934
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.100
So again, this is x sub 1

935
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.500
y sub 1

936
00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.800
x sub 2 y sub 2 you

937
00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:52.300
 can literally copy the code from above.

938
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.300
And we need to have space on the y-axis. So

939
00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.800
 I'm going to make this go from negative 15.

940
00:54:58.700 --> 00:54:59.200
15

941
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:01.000
okay.

942
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:03.500
so using

943
00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.200
using the VEC function

944
00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:11.000
create

945
00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.600
this is Step. Number one.

946
00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.200
step two

947
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.200
draw using

948
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.600
the draw function

949
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.900
draw the vector

950
00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.500
on the figure

951
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.800
Again, the code is right up there.

952
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:41.900
Then step three.

953
00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.300
Create a transformation matrix.

954
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.900
transformation

955
00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.400
matrix to rotate

956
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.500
V sub 1

957
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.200
by 90 degrees

958
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:07.200
step 4

959
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.700
multiply

960
00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:19.000
V sub 1

961
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.200
by the transformation matrix

962
00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.900
transformation matrix

963
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.200
And let's call this one rotate.

964
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.400
Okay, so that's the name of the Matrix. Yes. That's

965
00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.100
 the name of The Matrix.

966
00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.400
I'm going to color rotate.

967
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.900
In the P dot array something something.

968
00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:56.000
Can you can do this like so you can go?

969
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.300
V1 stop B sub

970
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:01.700
 1 rotate.

971
00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:06.000
But essentially be NP document multiply

972
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.900
 matrix multiplication.

973
00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.300
and you want to multiply

974
00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.200
the rotation Matrix

975
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:17.100
by

976
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.700
V sub 1

977
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.400
and step 5

978
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.200
draw the

979
00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.200
rotated

980
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:37.300
vector

981
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:45.200
Now you actually need something. You need

982
00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.000
 to know something here.

983
00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.100
On the hint here.

984
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:55.800
or

985
00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:58.700
step four

986
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:00.500
hit

987
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.700
use the math.

988
00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.400
library for the trigonometric functions

989
00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.100
That's the first hint.

990
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:39.500
remember

991
00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:44.800
switching

992
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.500
polar to Cartesian

993
00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.800
Let me give you.

994
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.300
the transformation matrix

995
00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:03.600
Which they have?

996
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:05.600
here

997
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.400
if you want to convert.

998
00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:10.600
45 degrees

999
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.900
if you want to convert 45 degrees.

1000
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:20.000
clockwise

1001
00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:22.400
sign will be negative.

1002
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.200
If you want to rotate counterclockwise, and this

1003
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:29.800
 would be negative. Now. It doesn't matter if you go negative 490 degrees

1004
00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.300
 or positive 90 degrees this way go 90 degrees either

1005
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:32.700
 direction.

1006
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.700
All right, so

1007
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.000
Let me give you this.

1008
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.200
Code all right quickly. So this is going

1009
00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.300
 to be the rotation Matrix.

1010
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:50.700
Let's call it m sub rotate.

1011
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.300
B Matrix

1012
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.800
So we have cosine and sine.

1013
01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:29.600
It's only one of these side functions needs to be negative.

1014
01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.200
Amazing I didn't stick again.

1015
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.400
This has to be cosine.

1016
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:52.800
Yeah.

1017
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.200
I don't like that in mathmatics. They don't put the parentheses.

1018
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.300
I don't like this notation.

1019
01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.200
You have to put the parentheses because this is this is an argument of the

1020
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.900
 function. So I'm going to actually put the parentheses.

1021
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.500
You know math.

1022
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:16.600
is a

1023
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.000
difficult to learn as it is no need to make

1024
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.300
 the notation.

1025
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:26.700
obscure

1026
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.200
There we

1027
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.100
 go. That's that's much better in my opinion.

1028
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.900
Okay, let me give you this file.

1029
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.400
So you want to create one of these matrices?

1030
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.900
multiply to the vector

1031
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:45.900
and

1032
01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:47.300
plot it

1033
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.300
All right. So let's spend around 15 minutes

1034
01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:56.300
 on this exercise again, you can literally use the

1035
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.100
 code up here.

1036
01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.300
For reference. I'm also going to give you this file.

1037
01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.200
This is relevant. By the way.

1038
01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.500
Not this one this one.

1039
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.100
number eight

1040
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.200
stop you I'll attached right

1041
01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.600
 now. So this is

1042
01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.400
exercise 2

1043
01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.300
geometric

1044
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.300
transformation

1045
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.200
of vector

1046
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.700
Download by the way, if you if you

1047
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.800
 you need these libraries, right?

1048
01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.700
If you don't have them.

1049
01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.700
There are two ways you can go about this. You can either activate this

1050
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.600
 code to install it so you can go python.

1051
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.300
- M

1052
01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.000
pip install

1053
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.200
PLT

1054
01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.500
NP but that assumes we already have Pip

1055
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.100
if we don't

1056
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.300
you can just use collab like before.

1057
01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.000
literally upload this file to collab and you can

1058
01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.200
carry on.

1059
01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.100
I'll give you the code the code to call

1060
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:23.200
 up.

1061
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.100
Download the attached.

1062
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.200
notebook

1063
01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:35.700
complete

1064
01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:37.200
the exercise

1065
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.000
and see tutorial

1066
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.000
I'll change the number in a second.

1067
01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.500
H4 reference I'll paste the link in a second.

1068
01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:51.700
note

1069
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:53.300
you can use.

1070
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:55.500
collab

1071
01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.500
for the sexual size

1072
01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:15.400
Okay.

1073
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.700
Here's the notebook.

1074
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.000
And the tutorial is actually on the dashboard.

1075
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.200
It's not a dashboard.

1076
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:05.900
It's number 10.

1077
01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.000
So go and download this.

1078
01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.900
Notebook. Just click on this download button.

1079
01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.200
Upload it to call app.

1080
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.400
If you don't have Pip installed, I will attach

1081
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.100
 tutorial. I will give you the LinkedIn tutorial number 10

1082
01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.500
 in a second. I'm just gonna I'll upload it very quickly.

1083
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.400
So this is the link to tutorial 10.

1084
01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.000
if you refresh in a second you will get

1085
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.100
some more comments

1086
01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.000
and if you want you can have

1087
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:36.600
this example

1088
01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:42.500
you can you can okay, you don't have to you know,

1089
01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:42.800
 see.

1090
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.600
the example

1091
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.000
or use the urban

1092
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.100
okay.

1093
01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.700
let's spend around 10 not maybe 15

1094
01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:57.900
 minutes because you need to

1095
01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:02.000
Check the code as well, and then we'll look at the solution together.

1096
01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.300
Okay, don't forget once you're done to and send the

1097
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.800
 solution to me directly.

1098
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:11.500
Okay.

1099
01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.900
I will be with you in a moment.

1100
01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:22.600
you

1101
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.100
question from

1102
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.800
Ron and Richard Richard, I think I answered.

1103
01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.300
Yeah, so clockwise counterclockwise. It doesn't

1104
01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:47.600
 really matter.

1105
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.600
either 45 degrees

1106
01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.000
in quadrant to

1107
01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.500
I keep saying 45.

1108
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.300
90 degrees did I say 90 or 45

1109
01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:57.700
 here?

1110
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.300
90 degrees 90 degrees. So basically you

1111
01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:05.700
 want the light to be perpendicular to the origin to

1112
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:06.000
 V1.

1113
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.000
so the transformative vector

1114
01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.000
perpendicular to

1115
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.300
V1

1116
01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.400
can we just spec the rotation angle

1117
01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:16.900
 as radians?

1118
01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.300
Sure, if you can if just get it make it.

1119
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.900
Make it rotate 45 degrees.

1120
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.800
So it is vertical make it.

1121
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.100
rotate 45 degrees either clockwise or

1122
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:32.900
 counterclockwise

1123
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.600
so whichever method

1124
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.900
You think works you can try that?

1125
01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.900
Also want to show you something if it might help.

1126
01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.000
I'll type it here in a second.

1127
01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.900
No true. I wouldn't say anything. I was just

1128
01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.500
that's just my face when I'm talking. Let's look

1129
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.100
 at the solution together.

1130
01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:45.200
Because I actually kind of meant to make this I I

1131
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.000
 meant this to be.

1132
01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:50.200
Slightly tricky just I can specially enjoy

1133
01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.400
 your attention if I can ask everyone to please send me send your

1134
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.500
 code, whatever whatever you have, even if it's incomplete and

1135
01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.200
 even if there was a if there's error in your code.

1136
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.700
Again, because this helps me gauge.

1137
01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:08.100
You know the pace the pace of our sessions, so kindly do please

1138
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:11.600
 attach me attach the files directly, please

1139
01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.300
 to me and let me show you the solution.

1140
01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:17.900
Okay.

1141
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:19.800
So let's do this together.

1142
01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.500
Before we run out of time. So I'm gonna do

1143
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.200
 two things. I'm gonna do these steps. I'm gonna

1144
01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:28.500
 draw

1145
01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.200
my Vector V1, which is

1146
01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.300
 for reference then.

1147
01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.000
I'll create a transformation matrix. I'll show you how to create a

1148
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.400
 transformation matrix, by the way.

1149
01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.100
So I'm going to create my vectors. I'm going

1150
01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:44.900
 to go Vector. This is going to be V sub 1.

1151
01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.500
And it will take his argument a tuple.

1152
01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.000
So this will be 0 10.

1153
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:55.200
Okay.

1154
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.900
Again, I don't need to pass two two poles because by

1155
01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:02.600
 default it's X and Y displacement is

1156
01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.200
 zero anyway.

1157
01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.700
I just need to tell where the segment goes where

1158
01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:09.400
 the second point is. So and that's

1159
01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.400
 zero ten. This will give me that straight line like before.

1160
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.200
Then I'm going to draw this Vector. I'm going to go draw the

1161
01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.500
 sub one and

1162
01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:22.200
I'm gonna go obj equals ax and for the

1163
01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:23.700
 color just want to make it black.

1164
01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:27.400
Because it's the reference effect vector.

1165
01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.200
Okay, make sure the other libraries are

1166
01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.800
 imported. So I'm going to click on run all.

1167
01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:36.400
and then when I scroll down

1168
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.600
There is the line now. I want to show you how to rotate this.

1169
01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:44.700
45 degrees

1170
01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.800
so I'm going to create my rotation Matrix.

1171
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.700
And comment that line of code.

1172
01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.400
And if we look at if we look at the reference.

1173
01:22:58.300 --> 01:23:00.200
Up there it says that.

1174
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.200
We need to have cosine and

1175
01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.300
 sine and sine of cosine. So I already

1176
01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:13.300
 have the math library in scope.

1177
01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.500
So I'm going to use math dot cosine. I'll plug

1178
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:20.500
 in the values in a second then I have math outside.

1179
01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.900
Then I have math dot cosine.

1180
01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.400
Whoops sine and then cosine, right?

1181
01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.200
The cosine's go on the main diagonal.

1182
01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:33.400
like so

1183
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.200
what number should I plug in here?

1184
01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.700
And this has to be negative.

1185
01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.100
This is going to go.

1186
01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:55.600
Counterclockwise should be math. Yeah, but what no, what

1187
01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.100
 should be the Theta what should be the argument for these functions?

1188
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:03.700
radians

1189
01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.600
Okay, so

1190
01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:12.000
we can't put 90 because well.

1191
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.500
We're not an Apollo coordinate system. So yes, we

1192
01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:19.400
 would have to convert radian to.

1193
01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.200
Sorry degree to Radian.

1194
01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.600
If I show you the polar coordinate system.

1195
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.700
polar coordinate of course Pi is the

1196
01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.300
length of the unit circle half of

1197
01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:33.600
 that

1198
01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:37.200
would be 180 degrees.

1199
01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.800
So one unit circle is 360 Degrees half of that is 180. I

1200
01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.300
 have a 180 would be a pi over

1201
01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:44.500
 4.

1202
01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.200
Right, so but let me just pull up the picture.

1203
01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:52.900
Okay.

1204
01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.900
And there's actually two ways. I wanted to show you.

1205
01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:00.300
to solve this

1206
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:01.200
but

1207
01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.800
Which one of these is clear. This is yeah. There we go.

1208
01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:12.900
Okay.

1209
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:17.700
So Pi the length of the unit circle, so

1210
01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:21.100
 three obviously this would be 360 zero and

1211
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:21.900
 360 are the same.

1212
01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.300
Pi over 2 was 180.

1213
01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.500
So half of a unit circle.

1214
01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:30.000
And then 1/4 of the unit circle.

1215
01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:35.300
So this L shape we get 90 degrees. Our Vector right

1216
01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.200
 now is here our origin vector.

1217
01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.900
So we want to go 90 degrees clockwise.

1218
01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.700
It doesn't matter if you go left or right, but the point is to make it rotate 90

1219
01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:44.900
 degrees.

1220
01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.100
So let me show you two ways to do this.

1221
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:52.300
Kind of running from the ingredients so that

1222
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.000
 would be math.

1223
01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:57.500
Dot Pi Phi is a is an

1224
01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.600
 attribute of the math object over 4.

1225
01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:05.100
So I'm just going to take this and I'm going to call it.

1226
01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:07.200
Theta

1227
01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.000
I will not pi over 4.

1228
01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.400
Don't know why it's saying this I I did import math up

1229
01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:14.900
 here. Why are you

1230
01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:19.200
Okay, if I didn't if I did not input put this

1231
01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.600
 in here, I apologize. I meant to put math in here.

1232
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:27.400
Theta

1233
01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:28.900
Theta

1234
01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:30.600
data data

1235
01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.600
If you want to send me

1236
01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.000
 this round just go to collab.

1237
01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:38.800
then

1238
01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:40.300
file

1239
01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.500
download and you have the option of downloading either format.

1240
01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.500
And by the way, we can even save it to your drive for for later

1241
01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:49.400
 use so download.

1242
01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:51.700
IP okay.

1243
01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.300
There's my rotation Matrix. Let me activate this

1244
01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:58.900
 code multiply my rotation as against my original

1245
01:26:58.900 --> 01:26:59.300
 vector.

1246
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.700
And then if I want to draw my Vector, I'm just going to go.

1247
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:04.700
draw

1248
01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:07.600
V1 sub rotate

1249
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.500
obj and x and the C. Let's

1250
01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:11.900
 make it red.

1251
01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:14.700
and

1252
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:26.100
I meant to make this pi over to there we go. No now

1253
01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.700
 so here's the thing.

1254
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:28.200
Okay.

1255
01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.200
I want to know before I do that. I want to show you something. I

1256
01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:41.800
 want to show you them. Not the python implementation

1257
01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.700
 because I want to make this as mathematical as possible.

1258
01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:45.900
if I take you

1259
01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:50.100
Yes, but let me show you something. Let me show

1260
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:53.200
 you something. If I come here back the tutorial Let me refresh this.

1261
01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.300
I want to use this implementation.

1262
01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.000
this one

1263
01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.900
So if you remember we said that if you want to convert from Polar to Cartesian.

1264
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.200
I mean I already went through this in the start

1265
01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:12.000
 of the session, but I want to go the other way around.

1266
01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:15.000
So I cannot plug in.

1267
01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:19.700
the degrees because we're not in a polar

1268
01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.700
 coordinate system, so I have to

1269
01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.500
Convert the other way around now the radiant

1270
01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.800
 will obviously it's this but I already know what the length of my Vector

1271
01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.600
 is. It's just him so R is equal to 10.

1272
01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:39.000
But if I want to get my Theta I can use arctan. This

1273
01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:41.700
 is the inverse trigonometric function. It is denoted

1274
01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:44.300
 Octan or even ten to the

1275
01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:45.800
 power y to the power negative 1

1276
01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.200
So these are these two are identical. Okay, sometimes you

1277
01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.600
 will see this notation. Sometimes you will use that notation.

1278
01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.500
I'm going to use the archetype function to get

1279
01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:55.200
 the Theta.

1280
01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:59.800
and to get that I'm gonna have to put y over 10, so my

1281
01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.400
 Y is 10

1282
01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:02.400
and my X is

1283
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.500
y x is well my x is 0

1284
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.600
Okay, so let me show you how I'm going to do this.

1285
01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:11.500
All right.

1286
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.000
So I'm gonna go.

1287
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.200
theta equals math

1288
01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:29.900
Dot

1289
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.100
arcad or A10

1290
01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:37.200
and the ratio is y over X. So that's 10 over 0

1291
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.000
 what? I cannot divide.

1292
01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:39.700
over zero

1293
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.300
So let me just make it converged to zero make it

1294
01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:45.400
 as close to zero as possible. So zero zero.

1295
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.300
One, okay. I want to it's just an approximation.

1296
01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.500
Let me also print it.

1297
01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.600
And it gives me 1.57.

1298
01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:03.600
Now, why did they not apply? Why did

1299
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.200
 not do what I want?

1300
01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:06.800
That's it should have happened.

1301
01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:08.600
and

1302
01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.900
what what did I do wrong?

1303
01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:26.200
No, no, I used A10. I literally have it here in

1304
01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.200
 front of me. I've sold it before.

1305
01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.800
Then what am I doing wrong here rotation?

1306
01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500
It's literally the same code let me.

1307
01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.400
Let me see what I've done wrong here.

1308
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:51.600
That's eight and that's it the array cosine.

1309
01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:53.800
sign

1310
01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:59.100
I mean look at this. This is exactly the same code I

1311
01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.700
 had from before.

1312
01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:01.800
There it is.

1313
01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:04.500
same same

1314
01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:07.700
let me see what I've done wrong here.

1315
01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:12.200
Yeah, so there's multiple ways so we can convert to

1316
01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.100
 read I just want to let me just focus here. Let me see what I've

1317
01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.900
 missed here Matt tomorrow.

1318
01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:19.700
rotation back here

1319
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:23.300
Thank you.

1320
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:36.600
I plug in this number.

1321
01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:42.100
What?

1322
01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.200
What did I miss?

1323
01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:57.000
See because in order for this line to be.

1324
01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.000
flat

1325
01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:04.300
the y-axis must well, we must say it why

1326
01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:07.700
 so why is it why Sub Zero y sub 1 should be 0

1327
01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:10.400
 to stay on the slide ex. However must

1328
01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.500
 go negative five points if I print V1

1329
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.400
 sub rotate and if I look at the elements,

1330
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:20.200
so this is x sub 1 x sub 2

1331
01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.400
 y sub 1 y sub 2

1332
01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.200
so this is incorrect. So, what did I do

1333
01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:31.500
 wrong?

1334
01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.800
Here, there we go. That's my problem.

1335
01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:38.000
This is meant to be cosine.

1336
01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:42.000
Yeah, thank you. Tuba.

1337
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:44.600
Okay. There we go.

1338
01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.200
This is what I was trying to do.

1339
01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.600
So yes.

1340
01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.400
I really wanted to show you this implementation because

1341
01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:58.700
so that we know we can we can first of

1342
01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:01.800
 all to show you the purpose of the inverse trigonometric functions and

1343
01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.800
 that this is one way we can convert back.

1344
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.500
And go we can alternate from Polar quality

1345
01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:08.000
 to Cartesian.

1346
01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.200
And the other solution is to use, you know,

1347
01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.400
 the ones you've suggested which is the use the Radian.

1348
01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:15.600
so

1349
01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:20.200
what do I make what was supposed to do?

1350
01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:26.000
I make this pi over 2. So this is

1351
01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:27.300
first option

1352
01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:34.700
in the second method is to do it this way.

1353
01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.000
This is going from

1354
01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.800
polar

1355
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:41.500
to Cartesian

1356
01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.000
and this is

1357
01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.700
degree to

1358
01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:55.400
Radian

1359
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:00.900
Okay, let's try again.

1360
01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:10.000
And of course we want this to be 90 degrees. So I'm gonna make this

1361
01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.500
 pi over 2.

1362
01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:11.400
There we go.

1363
01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.200
the okay, that is correct one, but

1364
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:24.500
I was just trying to I cannot make this zero.

1365
01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:27.200
So I just made it very close to zero.

1366
01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.500
So and of course trigonometric functions, they

1367
01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:36.000
later Market. We need to

1368
01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:39.900
 maybe later on. We'll talk about the sinusoidal function and talk

1369
01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:40.800
 about the amplitude.

1370
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:41.700
so

1371
01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.100
I will show you one late in another session or on a

1372
01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:49.600
 separatory. I will show you the python implementation for trigonometric function.

1373
01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:53.800
So it will be able to handle the entire domain of

1374
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.200
 real numbers.

1375
01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:59.500
Okay, I have I already have that code I will maybe attach

1376
01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:02.200
 it and it will go through it in a separate session. But I think

1377
01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.800
 it will be interesting. Give us an assignment. Okay?

1378
01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:07.400
anyway

1379
01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:12.000
There is your solution.

1380
01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:16.300
This is solution or solution.

1381
01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:20.600
A that's one way to do it and solution B.

1382
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:22.200
the other video

1383
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.300
I think this is also useful when you want to

1384
01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:32.000
 have automation.

1385
01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:33.600
automatically

1386
01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.600
imagine you have like an app.

1387
01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:40.200
And you moving you want to

1388
01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:43.800
 like we're looking for Photoshop or get right? You want to apply Transformations, but

1389
01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:47.400
 these are both both of them are solutions. Okay

1390
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.700
 everybody.

1391
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.400
Our next session begins on Monday again

1392
01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.800
 for those of you who joined later. I want to apologize for pushing it.

1393
01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:58.600
To Saturday. I know for some of you you picked

1394
01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:01.000
 Sunday. Hopefully when you

1395
01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.100
 watch tutorial if you have any questions, let me know but our

1396
01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:08.400
Yeah module 4, excuse me. This is

1397
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.200
 the end of module 3 module 4. We will talk we

1398
01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:11.800
 want to switch to

1399
01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:17.800
diagonal matrices

1400
01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:22.400
we will revisit applications of computer vision if there's enough time

1401
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.600
 but we want to cover determinants characteristic polynomials

1402
01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:30.500
 and then eventually singular validity

1403
01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:34.200
 composition and a specific case of SVD, which

1404
01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:37.900
 is PCA which is like if you I'm

1405
01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:41.200
 sure you've seen session one, right? We said it has broad applications Finance

1406
01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.100
 economics.

1407
01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:46.200
Many many applications PCA is especially machine

1408
01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.500
 learning is is relevant. So we're going to work our

1409
01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:50.100
 way up towards.

1410
01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:52.900
PC and its applications

1411
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.200
until then

1412
01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.200
Thank you very much for joining me today.

1413
01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:01.600
And I hope to see you on Monday the exercise

1414
01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.000
 assignment tool will be uploaded soon as well.

1415
01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.000
Before we started next week.

1416
01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.100
Thank you very much. New one. Thank you everybody.

1417
01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:11.800
Bye for now.
