00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.100
But a matrix, you know a matrix, I mean, you know what it looks like.

1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.800
We've already seen it.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.700
matrices are denoted like

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.900
 so

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.400
so for example

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.000
to the power and

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.400
times that

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.100
so for vectors, we have raised to

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.100
 one particular power that will give us a sequence of an element

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.400
 so five elements in one set and a matrix obviously

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.600
 is a set of sets.

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.600
so it can be

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.400
a set with five elements in three rows

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.800
So what this could look something?

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.500
like this

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.400
keep it.

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.400
So in matrices do we indicate the number of rows first

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.300
 or the number of columns?

18
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
What would n be here?

19
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.700
And what would M be?

20
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.900
So n is the number of rows so we have two rows and three,

21
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.400
 so that's what we mean by by.

22
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.500
you know R to the power n times m

23
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.400
two rows

24
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.500
with three columns

25
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.700
and I hope you can be you know, it's probably self-explanatory. What

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300
 a column space is. We said we've already established that there was space

27
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.800
 being set.

28
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.600
So the column space for the Matrix, let's indicate this

29
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.700
 Matrix with the letter m.

30
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.900
Okay.

31
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.300
Once again, we want to make sure it's bold letter. So

32
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.000
 PF.

33
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.700
So the economic space of M would be what that sets

34
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.000
 of columns.

35
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.400
So we will get a vector 2 6 a

36
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.000
 vector one. Five a vector one negative 3

37
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.200
And then the row space would be well two one one and

38
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 six five negative 3.

39
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.200
That's it.

40
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.700
That's all the row space and column space are.

41
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.100
and of course, this is supposed to be real sorry

42
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.500
 and of course column space would be all of the

43
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.400
the sets that make up the row in in

44
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.000
 The Matrix sound.

45
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.200
Okay, so, oh we will

46
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.800
 use this glossary.

47
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.400
So that we can you know easily.

48
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.200
And talk about anything to do with matrices neural networks.

49
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.400
3D plots

50
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.900
And every time we use words like this, we know what we're talking about.

51
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.000
All right.
