00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.300
let's say we want to have a system where we

1
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.600
group or put words under categories

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.200
and we want to do this automatically. We don't want to do this manually.

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.000
So for example, let's say you want to create a

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.700
 social media application and you want to

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.200
you know, let's think about words that can mean very different

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.300
 things in different contexts.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
So the name of a company like apple, right?

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.100
 Apple could be a fruit. It can be a company.

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.800
How we know what it means? It depends on the text surrounding it.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.400
Or topics or or books if you want to or a

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.400
 web pages you want to associate web

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.000
 pages by different topics. So this webpage is about Finance.

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.400
 This webpage is about sports this web

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.900
 pages about

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.500
football whatever

16
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.500
How would we?

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.100
How would we go about classify Google everything we have?

18
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.900
is a vector of numbers like so

19
00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.900
okay.

20
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.300
Let me show you what an example.

21
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.800
Let's say we have we have these three words and they represented as vectors

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.600
 of distributions.

23
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.700
Cosine similarity is about this.

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.500
I'll show you how we calculus in a moment.

25
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.800
But it is the angle.

26
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.700
created by these two vectors

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.400
the smaller the angle the closer they are

28
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.700
 to each other.

29
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.200
They have a closer meaning they're associated with each other enough. Obviously the

30
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.700
 father. They're apart the less similar. They are this is

31
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.300
 a very good example. This is a very nice picture so you

32
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.400
 can see the cosine similarity of

33
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.300
drone

34
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.400
or the code the code that the angle of drone and helicopter and

35
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.900
 Rocket are

36
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.500
Closer to each other relative to you know

37
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.700
 Goose eagle and B.

38
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.500
So if you would take the cosine similarity of drone and

39
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.600
 ego you'd have what

40
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.500
 we call it an up.

41
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.400
Is that an obtuse is that an obtuse angle? But it's a

42
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.000
it's not even it's even less than 45 degrees.

43
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.700
Anyway, you'll get a bigger cosine symbolarity anyway, but

44
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.400
 I'm trying to say is the larger the angle the less similar

45
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.900
 they are. So for example B and Rocket, you know.

46
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.900
They're very dissimilar.

47
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.300
So what I want to show you is how to produce such a thing.
