00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's return to the notebook for transformations.

1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.300
And let me create a new section here.

2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.800
Call this linear transformations.

3
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.900
Okay. I'm going to borrow this bit.

4
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.100
Close that.

5
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.900
And I'm gonna go from 10.

6
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.800
to 10

7
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000
also on the y-axis.

8
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.300
So 0 will be the middle of our plot.

9
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
PLT is not defined.

10
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.500
PLT is not defined because I need to run these cells so we run

11
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.800
 them all.

12
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.800
Okay.

13
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.100
So when we draw vectors, we're going to draw it.

14
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.400
here in the middle

15
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.100
Okay, let's look at let me draw another. Let me draw a vector to

16
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.900
 get started with.

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.600
Here we have V sub 1 again from before.

18
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.300
Okay, again, I've created this functions to

19
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.100
 abstract them away. So the origin of this

20
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.900
 Vector will of course be zero.

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.200
So if we set this to zero, that means you're going 0

22
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.300
steps from 0 well

23
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.800
That means you're not going to move anywhere on the x-axis or you

24
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.700
 have set it here to four.

25
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.400
And since our origin for the other wax, it's also it's

26
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.500
 also zero that means four steps up. Anyway, you

27
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.600
 basically you draw a vertical line.

28
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.900
And if I want to draw this Vector, I'm going to go draw.

29
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.300
V1

30
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.700
I need to set obj to the ax

31
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 object.

32
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.700
And there's my line.

33
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.400
If you want me to make it taller I can just make it

34
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.500
 10.

35
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.200
Make it down to wait.

36
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.600
Okay.

37
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.900
So let me show you some what are an example of some geometric

38
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.600
 transformations.

39
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.000
And I have a PDF. I want to

40
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.300
 show you.

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.800
type saved here

42
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.100
yes, for example, this is an example of going from

43
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.100
up to two-dimensional space to three-dimensional space so that this is

44
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.000
 a linear transformation.

45
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.600
Okay, so if you want to project a plane.

46
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.500
It's in a three-dimensional space. You can do that. Obviously this has applications and

47
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.700
 computer vision.

48
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.700
And computer vision is a subset of machine learning.

49
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.300
These are the conditions we talked about.

50
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.800
Where is the

51
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.600
The transformation that I this is

52
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.100
 the one yes, so here look at this one.

53
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.800
Let me show you.

54
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.900
I'm gonna we're gonna go through some of these let me begin with the dish

55
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.800
 for example this year.

56
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.300
This is the sheer transformation.

57
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.500
So for example, if we have in our case, we have a straight line.

58
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.400
 Yes. Now, of course a matrix or I

59
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.300
 should say a plane.

60
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.600
is

61
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.100
You can imagine it being a moth a multitude

62
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.700
 of vectors.

63
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.000
I'll show you in the code of what I mean, but I want to show you how we can

64
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.000
 take these transform these geometric transformation matrices.

65
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.400
to modify

66
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.200
The shape of our vectors so we will start with

67
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200
 the vectors later on. We will look at transforming matrices doing exactly what

68
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.800
 you're saying here.

69
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.200
like skewing matrices

70
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.600
you know when you use Photoshop if you ever use Photoshop

71
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.600
You know you can skew.

72
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.800
a picture

73
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.800
You know, like if you if you're trying to put you know, someone's head

74
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.100
 on the body of an elephant, you know.

75
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.100
This is what you're doing. You're doing Matrix Transformations. Okay,

76
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.800
 so let me show you how for example The Matrix tissue. Okay

77
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.200
 here stands for the degree to which you want to skew or

78
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.800
 you want to apply sheer to the play.

79
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.200
Okay, let's begin with the basics. We will eventually get to that

80
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.700
 point later on.
