00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.700
so the product of ATA

1
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.300
that's where you multiply

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.100
This Matrix and let's transpose you remember what

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.400
 it transposes a transpose is when where The

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.100
 Columns of The Matrix?

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.600
Become the rows of the Matrix. So

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.200
 here a if we were if I would

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.700
 copy this that would give us the original Matrix. We

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.900
 have up here times.

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.600
The same Matrix but it's rows and columns have been stopped now

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.100
 to multiply these out.

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
I'm actually going to use numpy because

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.500
 I don't want to.

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.100
Do this by hand?

14
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.000
I will create.

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.900
and new notebook

16
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.200
I'm going to bring a numpy.

17
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.700
as NP

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.600
and so we have a

19
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.600
over the elements in this Matrix we have

20
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.000
10 to 5 11

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
10 2 5 11

22
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.200
so I'm gonna print a and I'm going to print a

23
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.300
DOT T. If you want to transpose The Matrix use the T

24
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.600
 attribute from numpy.

25
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.700
So let me run this.

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.400
And let me run that.

27
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.200
Okay.

28
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.000
So just like we saw in.

29
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.900
vs code

30
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.000
Now I'm going to multiply this. I'm going to go NP dot Matt

31
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 multiply.

32
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
and I am going to get

33
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800
a DOT t and a

34
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.100
which will give us the Matrix.

35
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.200
One two five seven. Okay, this one exactly. So we'll

36
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 get a third Matrix.

37
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.500
one two five seven five one two

38
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.000
 five

39
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.900
seven five

40
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.200
seven five

41
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.900
one two five
