00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.500
How do we get?

1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.100
you

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.600
and V transpose

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.900
so for that we need to talk about the

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.900
first of all the definition of an orthogonal Matrix the

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 distinction of orthogonal and also normal and then

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.800
 we will switch and talk about the

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.800
The gram Schmidt algorithm one of the algorithms with

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.200
 which you can.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.200
Or talk in the lights.

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.500
This is the

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.200
tutorial from week one which I have updated

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.300
an orthogonal Matrix

13
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.600
sometimes synonymously called

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.300
 orthonormal

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.100
is a matrix that is

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.600
whose vectors?

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.400
In the column space imagine you

18
00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.900
 have a matrix.

19
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.700
If you take the columns as vectors.

20
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.800
And you take the product? Excuse me?

21
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.500
the Dutch product

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.100
Also known as the inner product.

23
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.200
So we take the dot product of two columns in that

24
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.300
 Matrix.

25
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.500
And their value and the value of this product becomes zero.

26
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600
Then we say that The Columns of this Matrix are

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.900
 pairwise orthogonal.

28
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.400
What does it mean for the dot product of two vectors

29
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.200
 to be 0 does anybody know like if you were to plot

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 these two vectors?

31
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200
And their product is zero. What would those two

32
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.800
 vectors look like?

33
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.300
Precisely they would be perpendicular.

34
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.600
Just like we saw in that cosine similarity example you would

35
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.000
 get this.

36
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.700
remember when we when we took the cosine similarity

37
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.800
 of

38
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.100
all the time dog and building the angle was quite big.

39
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.500
but anyway for two vectors to orthogle means

40
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.700
 that they have

41
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.000
well, they're perpendicular.

42
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.100
if this was cosine similar, this would be they have

43
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.700
you know little to nothing to do with each other.

44
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.800
That's

45
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.400
that's an orthogonal matrix. It's column vectors.

46
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.500
 We all be orthogonal to each other perpendicular.

47
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.700
now

48
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.600
In some literature if you see here in some literature an

49
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.200
 orthogonal Matrix is a matrix to which only

50
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.500
 the first condition applies.

51
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.800
So notogama Matrix is all the Matrix whose color

52
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800
 vectors are perpendicular.

53
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.800
and orthonormal Matrix

54
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.100
Is a matrix to which both conditions wanted to apply

55
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.000
 what is conditioned to?

56
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.200
condition two says that the magnitude

57
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.100
of each column Vector is zero.

58
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.200
How do we calculate the magnitude we've seen this before

59
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.800
 in one of the previous sessions?

60
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.500
This is the magnitude.

61
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.200
And you know also it's known as a norm.

62
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.700
easier synonyms

63
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.700
Typically you want to use double the two vertical bars.

64
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.300
 Sometimes you will see single bars, but

65
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.100
 this is not good practice because single bars are

66
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.300
 also used for the absolute value.

67
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.400
Anyway, the week calculate the magnitude of

68
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 a vector is to take

69
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.900
its components. Let's say this is a vector

70
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.600
 v over R4 so four dimensional vector.

71
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.400
You take all four of its components Square them.

72
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.000
And it add the add up

73
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.500
 to some and then take the squares of that sum.

74
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.100
If that becomes zero.

75
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.100
Or if it becomes one that then you have a unit vector.

76
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.500
essentially unit vectors one who's

77
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200
radius is one.

78
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.300
So

79
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.100
Here if I return to.

80
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.500
this other file

81
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.600
it's called orthonormal.

82
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.000
Because it's magnitude is zero.

83
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.700
and

84
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.300
there's a word called normalize.

85
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.800
normalize is a

86
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.500
normalization is where

87
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.600
the largest component in a vector is

88
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.900
 one and the smallest component is in the vectors 0 this

89
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.700
 is after normalization.

90
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.000
I'll show you how that's done in a moment.
