00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.300
Okay. Now we need to calculate the singular

1
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.400
 values and that's just eigen.

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.600
If you remember how we find the

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.300
 eigenvalues of The Matrix.

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.800
First we use the determinant function.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.500
And then we get the characteristic polynomial. Let

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.800
 me pull up it previous tutorials just to refresh your memory.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.300
Okay. So for step three, there's a sequence of steps where we're

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.500
 just gonna since we've already looked at that we're gonna skip right to

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.900
 the value, but let me refresh your memory.

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.000
Here's how you calculate the eigen values of

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.300
 Matrix. So let's say this is our Matrix.

12
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.300
We take the identity Matrix.

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.500
You know, that's just one across diagonal multiplied by

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.200
 Lambda. This is just this is the

15
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.800
the thing that is meant to be determined.

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.200
This is the indeterminate and we we want to determine what the values

17
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.600
 of Lambda are. So we multiply the scalar value by this identity

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.700
 Matrix we get lambdo.

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.300
across diagonal

20
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.700
then we take the difference of Matrix a minus this

21
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.300
 new Matrix.

22
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
And I give this characteristic polynomial and then we solve for

23
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.800
 Lambda we get two roots.

24
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.500
We we put access for our eigenvector.

25
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.100
And then we solve for the roots.

26
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.600
And these will be and these will be the values for our eigen

27
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.800
 back here.

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.200
Yeah, so this Matrix.

29
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.200
Is that Matrix after we plug

30
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.600
 in one of these eigenvalues?

31
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.100
So for this Matrix we chose one so you

32
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.700
 plug in one inside as we plug in one

33
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.400
 for Lambda.

34
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.800
And this Matrix will be changed that Matrix.

35
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.100
So we'll get the eigenvector.

36
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.500
When we solve this system.

37
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.900
Okay, so I'm going to skip this whole step.

38
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.800
And just give you the the eigenvalues.

39
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.600
these two matrices

40
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.800
a transpose times a

41
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.500
a times a transpose the eigenvalues for these two.

42
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.300
I am going to return.

43
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.500
to

44
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.200
Collab, this is Step. Number one.

45
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.300
This is the number one.

46
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.100
step number two was this

47
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.000
Okay, step number three.

48
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.100
the eigenvalues so I'm going to

49
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.100
 denote this as

50
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.500
a t a

51
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.100
and this one aat

52
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.800
run that again.

53
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.200
this

54
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.400
now if you want to calculate the eigenvalues there is

55
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
 an attribute or I should see object in numpy

56
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.500
 called linear algebra. So I'm going to go NP the

57
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.800
 linear algebra and I valves I

58
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.500
 can values.

59
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.900
So let's extract the eigenvalues for the first Matrix.

60
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.200
This will give us 50 and 200.

61
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.400
I do the same for the other one.

62
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.700
Yeah, so step three is eigenvalues for both matrices. I'm

63
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.000
 going to print.

64
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.800
this one

65
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.600
and I'm going to print this one.

66
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.400
And so the eigenvalues are 50 and 200.

67
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.800
But what we do is we take the square root of these.

68
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.200
So the square root of 200.

69
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.700
The square root of 200 is what 200?

70
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.700
Time out the power 2.5.

71
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.400
That's 14.4.

72
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.300
Just like we have here.

73
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.500
14.4

74
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.300
And the square root of 50.

75
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.900
would be

76
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.900
7.07 Okay, so we've

77
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.500
we have found.

78
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.600
The Matrix

79
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.000
S

80
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.100
The Matrix contain the singular value so the square root of

81
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.300
 these values are the singular value

82
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.700
Which I will denote a sigma so Sigma sub

83
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.700
 1 will be.

84
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.100
Let's just the first one.

85
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.000
at zero

86
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.200
But then I need to take the square roots. I have to import the

87
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.800
 mat.

88
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.600
the math Library so important math

89
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.000
And then I'm going to go math.

90
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.300
That sqrt.

91
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.700
And the same thing for Sigma.

92
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.700
2

93
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.500
I'm going to print these.

94
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.500
Sigma 1

95
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.900
okay.

96
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.000
14

97
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.300
and this would be seven.

98
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.600
points

99
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.600
Okay.

100
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600
so

101
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.000
we get this Matrix.

102
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.800
this is actually step 4 right step three is just

103
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.500
Sigma 1 and sigma 2 so Sigma

104
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.900
one we said was equal to 200.

105
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.400
Sigma

106
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.000
2 was equal to 50.

107
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.200
then

108
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.200
Or number four. We just take square root of those Sigma. So let

109
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.300
 me just add another Matrix.
