00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.200
We want to create our neural network.

1
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.800
So let me

2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.800
Write the code first.

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.500
I will then take you to the slide to show you.

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.400
the picture of the architecture

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.200
 and then I'll show you the

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.600
The Matrix operation we call convolution

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.100
So this is going to be called.

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.700
building the

9
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.300
neural network model

10
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.800
so we will instantiate the sequential class like we

11
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600
 saw in the previous notebook.

12
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200
again, because we again because we are critic a

13
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.500
 sequence of

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.500
layers input layers and layers output

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.600
 layer

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
of course, we can stack onto this network other types

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.900
 of layers, but we're just going to have

18
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.500
we will have two convolutional layers three convolution layers.

19
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.700
two Max pooling layers

20
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.000
One Flat layer

21
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.600
and

22
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.600
two dense layers

23
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.700
What are these we'll see in a minute.

24
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.600
So we have the input layer. We have

25
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 one con 2D layer

26
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.400
 all by a Max pool layer.

27
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.400
And we will do this three times flat layer and

28
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.500
 two dance layers. This is the architecture.

29
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.900
Let me show you a picture of it.
