Open a new notebook, and I'm going to call this.

1
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.800
LED composition

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.600
first some background into

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.500
linear decomposition

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.600
Let me come back to the markdown file.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.300
Suppose we have a matrix.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.700
and we'll call this Matrix a

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.600
we can Factor this Matrix.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000
into two matrices lnu

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.100
now what is L? And what is you?

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.100
a

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.100
is the original Matrix?

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200
U is the upper triangle Matrix

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.400
Which is also the solution.

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.300
When you eliminate the rows if you

15
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.100
 get your Matrix into upper triangular form.

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.100
You have done your elimination. So this is what the

17
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.900
 U stands for.

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.600
so you

19
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.100
is the upper triangular triangle Matrix

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.600
 the L part which stands for lower triangle.

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.400
is the product of all of

22
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 the elimination matrices so there is

23
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.000
a component that is not part of

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.200
 this.

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.400
formula the elimination Matrix
