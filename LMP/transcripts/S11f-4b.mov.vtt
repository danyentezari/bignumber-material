00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.100
So we are building something of this sort.

1
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.600
This one has two card layers that one has three.

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000
And this one has two backs per layers double also.

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.800
Okay, that one also has okay. So actually it is this one.

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.800
It is this one. So this is the first convolution layer.

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.100
Okay. So this one it just has one convolution layer less

6
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.600
 and one density or less. Anyway, the point is this.

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.300
we'll use the convolutional layers which are just

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.600
stack of matrices or tensors

9
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.100
to represent this picture in all of its three

10
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.700
 color channels.

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.200
Then we're going to use a Max pool.

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.500
to

13
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.400
and something that is not visualized here something that is not plotted here

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.200
 and not even there.

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.100
Is the kernel?

16
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.700
Let me double check that.

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.100
Do we have a kernel in here?

18
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.900
Yes, but it's not it's not it's not.

19
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.200
It's part of the convolution here. So there's a there's a matrix

20
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.100
 inside kind of 2D layer, which is

21
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.500
 called the the filter. So it's not visualize you

22
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.200
 although it should have been that would have been more clear, but it's one

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.000
 Matrix call involved with another Matrix and the

24
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.500
 result of that Matrix. Well then be

25
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.100
pulled

26
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.400
inside this other Matrix

27
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.000
the idea here is to

28
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.300
contain the important.

29
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.100
activations from this Matrix

30
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.100
so

31
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.900
Let's keep this picture in mind. Let me take you to.

32
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.200
Vs code to show you what a convolution is first.
