# Python Assignment 1:
# See steps 1 to 4 in this file.
# DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE GIVEN LINES OF CODE. 
productA = ["Apple iPhone 12", 4000]
productB = ["Samsung Note 12", 4599]
productC = ["Huwaei P40 Pro+", 3700]




# (1) Use the appropriate List method(s) to add productA, productB, 
# and productC to products_list. 
# You must produce a list that looks like this...
#
# List methods: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp
#
# [
#     ["Apple iPhone 12", 4000]
#     ["Samsung Note 12", 4599]
#     ["Huwaei P40 Pro+", 3700]  
# ]
products_list = []




# (2) Use square brackets to add the keys and values of 
# productA, productB, and productC to the products dictionary below. 
# You must produce a dictionary that looks like this...
# { 
#       "Apple iPhone 12": 4000, 
#       "Samsung Note 12": 4599, 
#       "Huwaei P40 Pro+": 3700, 
# }
products_dict = {}




# (3) Use dictionary methods to get the keys and values of 'products_dict'.
# Use the sum() function to get the sum of the prices for all of the products.
# Assign the total value to the variable totalPrice. 
# totalPrice should become 12299
#
# Dictionary methods: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp
#
total_price = 0;




# (4) After populating products_list, use approproate control statement(s) to 
# iterate over the products_list and to get the sum of the prices for all of 
# the products. Hint: use the increment (+=) operator in your solution.
# totalPrice should become 12299
total_price = 0




# (5) Use the print function and string methods to form this sentence,
# "The price of Apple iPhone 12, Samsung Note 12, and Huwaei P40 Pro+ is 12299 AED"
# Hint: See W3schools for reference
