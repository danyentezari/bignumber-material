00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.200
Discrete mathematics. It really is your gateway.

1
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.000
to the most

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.700
amazing and

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.900
intelligent ideas

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.800
in mathematics

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.800
this is a

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.700
topic you really want to invest.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.800
time

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100
and effort in

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.100
it will pay off.

10
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.800
Greatly in your career software engineer

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.900
 or data scientist, or you may

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.400
 be an engineer.

13
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200
I mean in any aspect.

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
Of our world where mathematics is applicable.

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.500
And should you want to be proficient in that particular?

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.700
field of work

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.300
discrete mathematics. Well really take you

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.800
 far.

19
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.700
But let me draw your attention now here to the slide.

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.400
I told you that discrete mathematics is a subset

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400
 of pure mathematics and if I were to classify discrete

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.100
 mathematics in my classification is based on what I've seen.

23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.500
In books on discrete mathematics. Well, it will be

24
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.300
 most of what

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.600
You would find the computer mathematics excluding complex

26
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.300
 numbers and Analysis. Why because these two

27
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.500
 particular topics are concerned with

28
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.700
well not discrete things.

29
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.300
And to say something is this good is

30
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.400
 to say that it is whole.

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.700
It is.

32
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.100
not

33
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.700
continuous

34
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.300
a number that a number that

35
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.200
 has whole is something like

36
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.100
an integer

37
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.800
it is not there is no decimal involved.

38
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.200
 There are no fractions involved.

39
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.800
All right.

40
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.300
now let's talk about algorithms logic and

41
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.200
 prop propositional calculus now logic is

42
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.400
 about

43
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.800
deductive reasoning

44
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.600
it is about going from a set of premises.

45
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.500
a set of statements

46
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.900
and then arriving at one conclusive.

47
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.500
statement

48
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.300
and

49
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.500
to perform such an operation where

50
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.200
 we go from a set of premises or a set

51
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.600
 of arguments.

52
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.000
to some conclusive

53
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.000
statement

54
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.800
you will perform some sort of calculus on

55
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.700
 these premises.

56
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800
That is what propositional calculus is.

57
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.500
It is about.

58
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.100
dividing your arguments into statements

59
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.900
and then performing

60
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100
calculations on them like you would in

61
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.100
algebra, although the rules here are different and the

62
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.300
 operations that you perform on these premises are

63
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.400
 different.

64
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.300
But again, it's not something.

65
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.700
difficult to do with it something that is very

66
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.700
natural to us as human beings.

67
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.100
logic, that is

68
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.600
and if

69
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.300
Pride programming before and you've come across FNL statements.

70
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.100
And you probably know how that they're quite easy.

71
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.100
Assuming you already familiar with this attacks and you know,

72
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.900
 they're pretty easy to implement.

73
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.100
Of course, there will be situations where

74
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.500
you're not doing

75
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.700
a small number of logical operations

76
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.300
It can it it can get quite elaborate but

77
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.800
 it is.

78
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.200
important

79
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.200
for proofs

80
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.700
if you want to be able to

81
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.200
like I said read and even write

82
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.100
 your own proofs.

83
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.300
and propositional calculus

84
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.600
is

85
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.600
a necessity

86
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.400
But when it comes to applications and computer science or

87
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400
 even data science.

88
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.600
logic

89
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.300
Is at the heart of art well Machine learning.

90
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.900
It is at the heart of you know.

91
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.300
Game Theory

92
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.100
And game one of the applications of game theories for

93
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.800
 example how to set up rules.

94
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.800
to prevent fraud

95
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.900
or to cruise, excuse me to increase

96
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.500
customer acquisition or to prevent

97
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.600
customer attrition or employee attrition

98
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.800
It is used in natural language processing. So

99
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.500
 I'm sure we've all.

100
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.100
If you use Gmail.

101
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.300
And you're trying to write settings and you find the Gmail completes the

102
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.700
 sentence for you.

103
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.800
Or when you are texting.

104
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.000
and

105
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.100
the

106
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.300
operating system is able to correct your

107
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.000
 text still sometimes they make mistakes, of course, but usually they

108
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.900
 they get it right. Well like in

109
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.600
 all of these examples.

110
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.200
propositional calculus

111
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.000
is at the center the programming implementation

112
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.800
 of ideas and problems proposition calculus

113
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.300
 are implemented.

114
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.900
So

115
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.500
so we will shortly switch to switch to the tutorial and

116
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.100
 talk about this.

117
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.300
but

118
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.600
here's where proposition calculus is directly

119
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.600
 applicable with respect to algorithms.
