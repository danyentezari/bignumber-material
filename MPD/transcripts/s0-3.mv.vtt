00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.900
These are six of the 40

1
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.800
 courses you would find in a computer

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.200
 science.

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.400
Degree, a four year computer science degree

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.700
 assuming it is accredited by the ab-e-t.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.500
then

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.200
out of those 40 courses that you have

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.200
 to take to graduate with a for your degree these six

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.300
 are

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.200
the most important

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.700
And you can see here that computer programming is

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400
 only a small part of.

12
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
Computer science computer science is the

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.800
 mathematical discipline.

14
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.700
More specifically it is Applied Mathematics.

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.200
Let's go through these items quickly. So we have computer program.

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.800
 Of course.

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.600
Where you learn things like functions variables?

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.100
control statements like for loops

19
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.600
FNL statements right right classes objects that

20
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.900
 kind of thing.

21
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.300
Then we have perhaps what is the most important of

22
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.000
 them all for at least if you're a software engineer or a data

23
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.100
 engineer you'll be you you will have

24
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.400
 to be a master of data structures and algorithms.

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.300
So this is perhaps the most important course of

26
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.700
 them all.

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.900
And in order for it to be a master of this very important.

28
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.200
topic

29
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.900
you need to be able to read and understand.

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.800
the contents

31
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.500
In discrete mathematics. So if you were to pick up a discrete mathematics textbook

32
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.700
 and really we can cover discrete mathematics

33
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.300
 in one that's in one textbook, which is

34
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.800
 not true for

35
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.900
a subject like probability Theory or

36
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.400
Calculus for sure not calculus it will take a couple of books to cover.

37
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.200
at least a linear algebra even

38
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.800
so you will need multiple books to refer to.

39
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
if you want to be good at this book, whereas the screen mathematics

40
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.300
 really I'm you can there are

41
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.500
a few books

42
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.000
There are soft contain and those alone you can you can

43
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.700
 learn a lot from those at those books. My point.

44
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.200
 Is this really if you want to be an elite software

45
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.500
 engineer and Elite Daily engineer

46
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.200
 if you want to be able if you want to be someone who's able to

47
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.000
 work with and produce very

48
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.700
You know Advanced algorithms for solving very complex

49
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.500
 problems. Then you have to be a master of data structures.

50
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.200
 And in order to be a master of data structures. You

51
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.600
 have to be if we proficient into discrete mathematics.

52
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.700
But moving on.

53
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.800
the first three are very mathematical in nature the

54
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.900
 next three are very

55
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.200
You know.

56
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.900
Hardware related or

57
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.400
Applied Mathematics, so we have computer networks, which

58
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.600
 is systems that facilitate communication between computers.

59
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.000
The Internet is a very big part of a course

60
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.100
 on computer networks operating systems.

61
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.300
An operating system is the biggest unit of software

62
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.400
 on any computer.

63
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.900
and then computer architecture, which is how

64
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.600
You are able to interface with the hardware through

65
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.000
 software.

66
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.700
so if we have the computer hardware

67
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.400
then we have an abstraction called computer architecture and

68
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.600
 then we have low level programming language and then

69
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.700
on top of that you have a high level programming language like python,

70
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.200
 Java.

71
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.600
A PHP JavaScript Etc.

72
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.500
So if you want to be a master.

73
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400
of computer science

74
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.900
These are the six topics you need to you know

75
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.900
 know very well.

76
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.100
but if you want to go

77
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.000
to the next level

78
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.600
and be able to work on all kinds of

79
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.700
algorithms then

80
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.500
your priority would be data structures and algorithms.

81
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.300
and in order to get to that point

82
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.600
you must

83
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.300
be very comfortable with discrete mathematics.

84
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.300
Which is what we were about to talk about.

85
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.500
today
