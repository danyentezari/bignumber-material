Before I talk about discrete mathematics, I want

1
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.400
 us to first talk about pure mathematics

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.500
 because I want to start with two important definitions

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 to important terms to which we will

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.600
 be making reference throughout this workshop.

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.100
 And in fact, you'll be

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.800
finding references to these words throughout mathematical literature.

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.400
Okay so far if you remember what I said that I said there are two obstacles.

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.800
When you learn mathematics number one is the

9
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.300
 symbols number tools the terminology where we'll

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.100
 we're addressing the terminology right here.

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.800
and right now

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.900
a mathematical object

13
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.100
and this is a very

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.900
high level definition

15
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.400
Okay.

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.100
A mathematical object is something.

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.700
That you can put inside the collection.

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000
And to which certain?

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.400
operations apply

20
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.100
now, this is a very

21
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.400
That's a vague definition, but I'll

22
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.300
 give you an example of what a mathematical object is.

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.000
And integer or integers.

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.000
Integers are objects that you can

25
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.900
 put inside a collection.

26
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.700
The integer number system is a collection of integers.

27
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200
And these are objects to which you can apply operations like addition.

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.500
Subtraction multiplication, right? These

29
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.600
 are things you can do to integers. So that's one example

30
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 for mathematical objects real numbers.

31
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.800
Are also mathematical objects or complex numbers?

32
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.600
sets our mathematical objects

33
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.600
Matrices vectors tensors we have

34
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.000
 these things called spaces.

35
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.200
And Fields and groups and Rings. These are

36
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.100
 words from abstract algebra. You may have heard of these. If not,

37
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.900
 you definitely want to

38
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
you know put time aside to also be clear with these

39
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.000
 with with Concepts in

40
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100
 abstract algebra, which I'll also come

41
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.300
 to

42
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.300
so that's a mathematical object. I give you some examples.

43
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.800
By the way, if you're watching this.

44
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.500
Look at check out the video description where there will

45
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.400
 be a link to.

46
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.800
a document

47
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.400
where

48
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.200
these

49
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.900
you know words that I'm using these.

50
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.800
Terminologies to which I'm referring.

51
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.000
Will be defined in that document.

52
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.400
And they will be accompanied with examples. So if I

53
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.200
 say if I, you know, say the word

54
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.300
 space and then you want to know what that means. You

55
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.400
 can check the video description go to that link. You'll find

56
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.700
 the definition for that word and an example to make

57
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.900
 especially clear what that word means.

58
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.600
So that's a mathematical object.

59
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.600
Now then we have something called a mathematical structure.

60
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.100
a mathematical structure is

61
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.000
something that contains a mathematical object.

62
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.400
Again, a set can also be a mathematical structure.

63
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.500
if

64
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.700
have experienced programming.

65
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.400
Like a python we have these things called lists and

66
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.500
 sets and tuples right you can put elements

67
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.900
 at them.

68
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.400
Well, you know then a python a list cannot only

69
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.300
 contain things but it's but a list itself

70
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.700
 can be put into another list.

71
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.400
So and the same is true for I said,

72
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.400
 so I said itself is a mathematical object, but it

73
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.900
 can also be put inside another.

74
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.300
Mathematical object so you can have a set inside a set.

75
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.200
now

76
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.800
the outermost set

77
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.100
we call the structure and the

78
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.500
Its elements we call a mathematical object.

79
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.100
 So it's relative.

80
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.400
Okay.

81
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.100
And once again, we will look at an example of this to make it very

82
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.700
 clear. What?

83
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.900
I mean by these words.

84
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.500
So here's an example. This is a set.

85
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.700
In math, we indicate sets with curly brackets.

86
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.400
And it has in it some objects. What are these

87
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.300
 objects while they're integers? 1 2 3 4 5

88
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.800
so these are mathematical objects.

89
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.600
And the set that contains what we call a mathematical structure.

90
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.700
pretty easy

91
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.700
Okay.

92
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.100
So let keep those are words in mind

93
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.400
 because we will be making reference as to those

94
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.300
 words as we go along in the subsequent slides.

95
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.700
What is pure mathematics?

96
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.200
And I'm sure or I assume you've

97
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.200
 heard of something called Applied Mathematics, and you may wonder what?

98
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.300
These two are and how they are.

99
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.600
different from each other
