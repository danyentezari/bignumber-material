00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.700
And what about sets?

1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.800
They are mutable.

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.400
but here

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.700
you do not have any keys in indices sets.

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.500
Do not have any keys or indices. They have methods to

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.100
 find an element, but you cannot access.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.300
You know like you would to put our list.

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.500
so this is

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700
keyless for like a better words

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.300
and because it has no keys.

10
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.900
Which means you cannot?

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.900
There is no sort of unique identifier. You

12
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.700
 can only have unique values.

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.600
So no repetition.

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.900
With a tuple I can repeat I can if I want.

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.000
For some reason repeat Monday as many times I want.

16
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.600
Okay, I cannot change it afterwards, but I

17
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.300
 can have repeat values with a

18
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 set. However.

19
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.200
Let's say we have some brands of companies and we do

20
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.400
 not want to have any repetition.

21
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.200
Of course sets like in mathematics are

22
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.900
 indicated with curly brackets.

23
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.600
but

24
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.400
the elements in a set are not

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200
The other the elements in a set do not

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.100
 have keys, okay.

27
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.100
In mathematics you can you can like you can magic you put

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.400
 a subscript to say this is the first element second element, but

29
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.100
 not on python.

30
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.500
Which means that because you don't have any Keys associated with the element you

31
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.400
 cannot have any repeat values, so if you have some

32
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.700
 names of companies, you know like apple again.

33
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.800
Samsung

34
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.000
Nokia and so on

35
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.000
you cannot have repetition.

36
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.500
Okay.
