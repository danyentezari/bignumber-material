00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.100
Here's what we will cover.

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.400
first an overview of computer science

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.000
You want to make clear?

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.100
What this discipline is about and so

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
 you can better appreciate the role of discrete mathematics in

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.200
 computer science.

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.000
Now this quick mathematics.

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.000
and I want to

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.900
take you back to

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.300
Comments, I've made before about discrete mathematics. It is a it

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.500
 is one of the branches of mathematics that requires

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.800
 no prerequisites.

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.700
And what do I mean by prerequisite say what Calculus if

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.500
 you want to be able to understand differentiation

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.400
 and integration the prerequisite

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.900
 for single variable calculators

16
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.300
 algebra?

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.400
so

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800
you cannot just

19
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.800
jump to calculus without having some

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.500
 exposure to

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.500
At least Elementary algebra or for example if

22
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.200
 you want to study.

23
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.300
Probability theory if your data sizes. This is

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.300
 something

25
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.900
you know the center of white.

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.700
mmm

27
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.100
Well, you'll have to learn.

28
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.000
probably theory has a lot of prerequisites something that

29
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.100
is not even pointed out in many of

30
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.700
 the textbooks.

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300
probability theory has prerequisites in

32
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.400
single variable calculus linear algebra

33
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.800
 abstract algebra and discrete mathematics

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.500
now the script mathematics by itself has no

35
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.300
 prerequis. So what I mean is this if you're someone

36
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.500
 who has

37
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.700
taken

38
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.700
a high school mathematics

39
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.800
and you don't even remember classical algebra,

40
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.900
 you know things like

41
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.700
finding the square root.

42
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.500
You know.

43
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.600
Algebraic properties like associativity commutativity that

44
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.400
 kind of stuff right?

45
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.200
The quadratic equation functions. If you don't even

46
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200
 remember those and even if you haven't taken those you can still start

47
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.700
 with discrete mathematics. Why am I even making this point?

48
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.200
because discrete mathematics covers

49
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.400
the most fundamental mathematical

50
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.800
Concepts

51
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.000
Concepts that you will encounter in all of mathematics

52
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.500
You see one of the problems with learning.

53
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.100
One of the obstacles to learning mathematics is the

54
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.900
Symbols this is something I always say there are two obstacles that

55
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.000
 you will encounter when you want to

56
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.700
 learn anything in mathematics. One of them is the symbols.

57
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.000
the meaning of those symbols and the terminology

58
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.800
discrete mathematics will studying discrete mathematics will

59
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.600
 expose you to both these symbols

60
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 to which I'm referring and the terminology.

61
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.900
So if you want to become very proficient in any mathematical

62
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.300
 branch.

63
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.500
Whether you want to be a computer scientist or data scientists

64
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.900
 discrete mathematics is the place to start.

65
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.600
And should you be should you learn discrete mathematics

66
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.100
 you can then?

67
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.900
continue

68
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.800
developing your mathematical knowledge and enter the realm

69
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.700
 of pure at Applied Mathematics.

70
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.700
I will talk about we will talk about pure mathematics

71
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.000
 as well.

72
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.000
Then we will jump into the different.

73
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.400
subjects that

74
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400
are within

75
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800
The topic of discrete mathematics including logic and

76
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.200
 propositional calculus and how they relate to

77
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.000
 computer algorithms computer programming algorithms.

78
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.300
Data structures of which there are two categories and

79
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.800
 linear and nonlinear.

80
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.100
If you have heard of binary trees.

81
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.000
and

82
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.300
search algorithms on binary trees

83
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.400
 and if you want to know how those work.

84
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.600
And even how more advanced data structures and algorithms

85
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.900
 work?

86
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.900
then

87
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.400
graph theory is something you definitely want to look into.

88
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.700
 You cannot be a computer scientist. If you know don't know graph

89
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.900
 Theory.

90
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.500
And then we will.

91
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.500
How do two things after that introduction?

92
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.000
to these Concepts

93
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.600
We will look at the applications the direct applications

94
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.200
 of these topics and discrete mathematics followed by

95
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.400
 tutorial what I will take you to vs code,

96
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.600
 which is just some code editor.

97
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.100
And I will show you.

98
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.900
some mathematical syntax

99
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.800
and

100
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.400
in parallel the python

101
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.100
version of it

102
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.500
so I will show you a programming implementation, which

103
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.700
 I

104
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.600
know most of you are probably familiar with even if

105
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.600
 you don't or python you'll be able to make sets of

106
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.700
the code

107
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.400
so I'll show you the code version and the mathematical version

108
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.600
 of the same concept.
