Let's at the

1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.500
 high level. Let's talk about computer memory.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.600
So here we have a python file again.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.100
When you these are your this is your algorithm.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.800
These are your instructions and when you

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.200
 save them to file you have a program. So these are the concepts of program.

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.400
And here we have temporary storage.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.600
Okay.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200
When you run this program.

9
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.300
the things that you have declared in

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 this

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.300
program will appear in Temporaries temporary storage

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.200
Okay. So for example here we have a function parameter. That would be

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 put inside temporary storage here. We have a variable

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.900
 that will be put in temporary storage and so on.

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.700
Okay.

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.000
now

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.200
when the when these items are

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.200
 put into the temporary storage, they are

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.600
 not put in.

20
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.700
A particular order or at least not an order you as

21
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.500
 a human programmer will be able to appreciate.
