00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.200
Right. So I said we have two types of data structures.

1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.400
 We have arrays in which elements are put in

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.600
 some.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.200
linear order

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.000
and arrays are very you there pervasive

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.400
 right many things come

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.500
 in tabular form in the form of rows and columns. That's how we store data

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.700
 a lot but not always and they're this particular type

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.300
 of data structure. It's not appropriate in every situation.

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.400
The second time is the graph to the structure a subset of

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700
 which is a tree it is structure. Now. This is a graph.

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.600
And very quickly, let me introduces to some terms.

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.500
These circles we call the vertices.

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.100
Or they go by another synonym nodes. So

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.000
 these are either nodes. You can call them

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.700
 nodes if you want.

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.000
Or you can call them vertices now, you can see

17
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.500
 that we have these lines that go from one vertex to

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.600
 another.

19
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.900
These lines we call edges.

20
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.100
So very simply put a graph.

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.900
is

22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
compose of two things a set

23
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.900
of vertices

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.600
and the set of edges and the

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.400
 edges are the connections.

26
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.900
between the verses vertices

27
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.800
Now, of course if you see here, we also have this Edge that

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800
 comes back to the same vertex.

29
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.200
Understanding graphs are also allowed to understand something called

30
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.100
 finite State machines finite State machines are

31
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
 at the center of many things.

32
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.700
from vending machines

33
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.300
to

34
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.200
physics

35
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.300
to

36
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.600
regular expressions

37
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.000
and

38
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.000
If you're not familiar with regular expressions.

39
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.900
It is a form of programming.

40
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.500
And it is Central to applications like

41
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.300
 a natural language processing and natural language

42
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.000
 understanding.

43
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.700
Moreover and also another application

44
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.700
 of graphs or being able to understand graphs

45
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.100
 is building complex stateful

46
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.500
 machines.

47
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.500
A complex you applications with very

48
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.900
 complex user interfaces.

49
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.400
require

50
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.400
States there's something called a state

51
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.100
 that is well formalized and

52
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.200
it has to be something that is well planned ahead of time.

53
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.400
If you want to be able to build such applications.

54
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.800
with very, you know

55
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.500
elaborate

56
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.800
User Journeys. Well then.

57
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.500
You need to be able to formulate these

58
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.200
 mathematically.

59
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.000
and once again

60
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.600
the

61
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.200
mathematical subject that discusses such ideas is

62
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.300
 discrete mathematics.
