00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.100
And then finally, we have the dictionary now it is a dictionary.

1
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.700
That will that can allow us to build.

2
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.100
more elaborative structures

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.600
We can actually use dictionaries to create binary trees

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.000
 and graphs and we'll look at an example of that a shortly.

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.200
but a dictionary

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.100
it is mutable. You can add to it can remove from it.

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.300
It has keys but keys.

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.800
must be

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.800
defined

10
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.600
with two pools and lists you

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.400
 the programmer do not have to type in the keys with dictionaries you

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.600
 do.

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.300
And this has an special advantage.

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.300
So how do we create dictionaries and when we when we want to well?

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.300
associate

16
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.000
keys with the elements in a way that makes sense. So one example

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.900
 we can do is airports.

18
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400
Okay, so like sets dictionaries are indicated with

19
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.900
 curly brackets.

20
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.900
So let's say you have the code

21
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.200
 for an airport.

22
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.900
And you want to know to watch to which airport that

23
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.000
 below that belongs.

24
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.500
So for example in Dubai, we have the XP.

25
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.000
Which corresponds Dubai International?

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.900
Now this is not so bad. But there are some airport codes that don't

27
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.600
 even match the name.

28
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.400
Another one is let's say JFK even this one

29
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.300
 is not so bad. So, this is John F Kennedy.

30
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.100
What about the one from Canada Canadian airports?

31
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.600
 I think they have unusual name. What's the

32
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.800
 what's the airport code for the main airport in Toronto? Why

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.400
 YZ?

34
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.100
And the name of the airport is Toronto Pearson.

35
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
So a dictionary makes certain situations like this when you

36
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.500
 see something like that.

37
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.500
And you don't have another, you know know the value.

38
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.900
And you can even go the other way around. So let's say, you know the name of the airport, but

39
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600
you're not know it's code.

40
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.600
so we can

41
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.000
you can alternate.

42
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.500
And the way you would access a dictionary is the same as you

43
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.400
 would access a two-pole or an index you type

44
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.300
 in the name of the variable.

45
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.300
Open a pair of square brackets, but here instead of typing it

46
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.500
 index like a number you will type in the corresponding keys.

47
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.300
 So if you want Toronto Airport, you would type in why why

48
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.800
 is the other string?
