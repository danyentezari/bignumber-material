What if we have a multi multi-dimensional list

1
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.600
 like a matrix? So one

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.200
 of the things you need to know is when you have a list.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.500
You can't put different data types.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.300
 It can have exactly can have different data types.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.500
 So for example if you have some sort of data.

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.100
You can have numbers in here.

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.400
You can have strings in here.

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.500
you can have

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.900
even lists within lists. Here's another list.

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.500
Okay, so you can do this.

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200
Now how do we create a multi-dimensional data? So let's say here. We want to type in

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.400
 products.

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.400
And imagine you're constructing a an Excel

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.400
 sheet or what's what's what is

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.300
 a composition of an Excel sheet rows of columns.

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.800
rows of columns

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.200
so we have the brand of the product.

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.800
some particular model they have

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.700
and the price of that product

20
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.200
so that's the first row. That's the second row.

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.100
And let's see. This is the third row.

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.200
so people Samson

23
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.300
All right.

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.400
If we take this entire.

25
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.400
lines of code

26
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.400
put them inside the list we have now created for

27
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.200
 ourselves in metrics. So these are these are the columns.

28
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.200
And these are the rows and how do we how do we access the

29
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 price for?

30
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.600
the Samsung

31
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.000
you type in the name of the product. Excuse me type in the name of

32
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.600
 the variable.

33
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.500
And you first go roll. So

34
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.100
 the row here is 0 1 2.

35
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.000
Remember you have to count from 0, right? So

36
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
 0 1 2 and then once we

37
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.200
 are on the row we need to access the element.

38
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.200
from which we want to extract the value so 0 1 2

39
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.200
Okay, so this is a two-dimensional data, but

40
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.500
 we can actually have three dimensional data now there is a special library

41
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.100
 for working with.

42
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.600
a matrices and

43
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.300
the general type of a matrix called a tensor.

44
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.500
 It's numpy, right?

45
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.200
And we will look at

46
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.200
 examples of numpy as well. So what numpy you can have actually a

47
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.400
 stack of matrices. So if this is one Matrix

48
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.100
You can have a stack of matrices, which is what we call a tensor. And of

49
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.500
 course if you're into machine learning then

50
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.700
you need to know very well have numpy numpy works.

51
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.700
Okay, and if you've heard of pandas pandas

52
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.700
 is built on top of numpy.

53
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.600
And we'll also look at examples of both of those libraries. I have a number

54
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.700
 of slides ready.

55
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.900
That just that go into how a

56
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.500
 numpy array object.

57
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.300
Works what are the properties of that particular

58
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.900
 object and

59
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.200
how they work.

60
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.400
Okay.
