00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.100
now pure mathematics

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.700
If you pick up a book on pure mathematics and you

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.200
 look at the table of contents, you will find different.

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.700
Subtopics, but this is the one that I think.

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.900
is

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.400
as appropriate

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.500
and this is based on some.

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.200
books on pure mathematics setup come across

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.600
so sets

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.900
at the very top sets are ubiquitous to

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.800
 all of mathematics.

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.400
They're not difficult to learn the syntax involved is

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.100
 very minimal, but they're quite powerful topics and

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.700
many ideas have derived from from sense and

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.600
 we will cover set of course in the tutorial.

15
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.500
Then we have logic.

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.300
the study of logic

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.300
and

18
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.700
something we call Pop essential calculus the calculus.

19
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.900
of

20
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.500
Truth statements

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
again, this is relevant to writing algorithms because

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.700
And algorithms we have control statements.

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.400
and some control statements can become quite

24
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.900
elaborate

25
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.300
furthermore

26
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.100
a very important skill for any mathematician

27
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.500
Is being able to write and understand

28
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.300
 proofs?

29
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.200
well understanding propositional logic

30
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.800
is Central to

31
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.600
Being able to read and perform proofs. Once

32
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.100
 again, we will look at proposition calculus in the tutorial.

33
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.200
And then we have something called an algebra. You know,

34
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.400
 when here when I see algebra, I'm specifically referring to an allergy break

35
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.300
 structure. If you remember in the previous slides we

36
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.700
 talked about something called a mathematical strap structure while an

37
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.600
 algebraic structure is a type of mathematical

38
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.000
 structure.

39
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.800
things like Fields rings and groups

40
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.300
these words that I just brought up.

41
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.600
You will find in.

42
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.700
You you could find any mathematical literature and you

43
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.400
 need to be able to understand what the author means when they

44
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.400
 say for example, this is a field.

45
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.300
or these following elements

46
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.600
if your data scientist, for example

47
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.000
and you want to

48
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.500
understand how some very Advanced machine learning algorithm

49
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.000
 works and how it is implemented.

50
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.500
You will.

51
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.300
find the formal definition of that particular model in a book or in

52
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.500
 an academic paper and

53
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.700
they will inval invariably or very likely

54
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.000
 I should say refer to.

55
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.300
mathematical structures that are discussed in

56
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.400
 abstract algebra

57
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.900
moving on we have that something called congruence, which is

58
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.600
really about divisibility

59
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.700
and integers

60
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.100
And how is this relevant? Well?

61
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.800
in cryptography

62
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.300
cryptography at its core has or uses

63
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.400
 prime numbers. And what is

64
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.600
 the definition for prime number?

65
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.500
It is a number that is either divisible by itself or one.

66
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.500
now that is a very small insight into

67
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.200
 our cryptography works, but

68
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.300
Again, this is something if you want to understand cryptography, you

69
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.400
 have to read discrete mathematics.

70
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.700
 And by the way, if I can just make a company in your discrete mathematics is

71
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.300
 a subset of pure mathematics and I will

72
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.500
 show you this hubs in a second, but let's move on very quickly. And then

73
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.000
 we have relations and functions relations. A relation

74
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.600
 is a description about how

75
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.900
 two sets are well associated with each other.

76
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.500
and functions well

77
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.600
There are two ways to look at functions. There is

78
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.400
 a map.

79
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.500
Perspective there's nothing we call a map which basically is

80
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.100
 something.

81
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.800
A map is something that takes elements from one domain and

82
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.000
 Maps them to an element in another domain in

83
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.400
 another set. I meant to say so we have the domain in

84
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.600
 the range.

85
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.200
Another perspective of function is something to

86
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.800
 which you

87
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.200
assign arguments

88
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.400
and then you have some internal operation and from which you

89
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.100
 will have an output.

90
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.800
And yet another perspective is that a

91
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.000
 function is a itself is another relation. So maybe

92
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.300
 maybe these are not helpful terms unless of

93
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.600
 course we start writing some mathematics which

94
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.400
 of course we will do.

95
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.800
Counting

96
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.800
or more broadly speaking combinatorics is

97
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.700
 how we use.

98
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.800
Or it's about clever ideas for counting large

99
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.300
 things very cleverly and without manual work

100
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.200
 manual labor.

101
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.500
And this has a lot of applications again in

102
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.300
 whether it's in cryptography or

103
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.000
compression

104
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.800
probability Theory

105
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.400
so if you if your data scientist

106
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.100
counting or you need to know combinatorics.

107
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.200
And there's no two ways about it.

108
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.600
Complex numbers of course complex numbers which has to with imaginary numbers

109
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.800
 and real numbers. We're not gonna get at that today add analysis,

110
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.300
 which is

111
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.700
calculus at a higher level

112
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.000
so it's concerned with things like Infinity Series limit

113
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.700
 sequences.

114
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.000
Once again, this is something you may also want to.

115
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.000
put on your bucket list if you're a data scientist because in probability

116
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.500
 Theory

117
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.400
there is an extension of this.

118
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.600
There's another branch of mathematics there is

119
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.800
 of concern to probability Theory and probability theorists

120
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.300
 called measure Theory.

121
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.500
and

122
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200
measure Theory

123
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.600
for the prerequisite is analysis.

124
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.200
So really what I've tried to make up

125
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.100
 the point of trying to get across is here

126
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.400
 is that
