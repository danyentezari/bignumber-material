00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.100
now data structures and graph Theory

1
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.900
a data structure is

2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.400
Analogous to a mathematical structure, right?

3
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.000
 We said it's a thing that contains elements and

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.400
 programming we have similar.

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900
Ideas, but we call them data structures. They are mathematical structures

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.600
 that contain data.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.100
as elements

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.100
in programming we could have an array.

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.300
or

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.200
a group there are something called a graph or

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.500
 it could be a binary tree.

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Now if you are a programmer.

13
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.700
Or if you're someone who is just learning programming.

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.500
then

15
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.800
the first thing that you will encounter is a linear

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.700
 data structure something like an array.

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.200
And python is they're called lists.

18
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.400
now

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.800
Sets as well, that's two poles.

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.400
These are linear data structures.

21
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.400
and these are

22
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.000
obviously they have very

23
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.300
wide applications, but they are not the

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.700
 right data structure in every scenario.

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.300
more useful a more useful type of data structure or a

26
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.800
 more useful

27
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.400
category of the structure

28
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.300
Is the nonlinear data structure or we can

29
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.700
 call them graphs. These are widely used

30
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 and social media applications and databases.

31
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.100
in The Internet of Things

32
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100
They're quite powerful.

33
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.000
but they can

34
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.800
they get they can be quite complicated.

35
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.800
and

36
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.700
some of these

37
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.800
will require

38
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.500
mathematical literacy

39
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800
at the very least you should be able to understand what?

40
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.100
Some concepts are in graph Theory. You need

41
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.600
 to know what is a for example a graph a multi

42
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.800
 graph a path.

43
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.900
the different types of

44
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.700
the different names we give to graphs.

45
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.100
Because these are they have names and these

46
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.600
 names will be referenced in

47
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.700
 order to explain an idea.

48
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.400
And if you want to know what the explanation is,

49
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.900
 well, you will come across some mathematical expression.

50
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800
So we might once again.

51
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.300
to become a very

52
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.700
You know Advanced or Elite.

53
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.400
software programmer programmer

54
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.900
or data engineer

55
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.700
or if you're in the world of Finance, you want to write algorithms

56
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.100
 for financial or algorithmic Trading?

57
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.500
then

58
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.100
you will invariably come across.

59
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.500
Graph-based data structures and if you want to understand

60
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.300
 them and Implement them on your own.

61
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.600
You'll have to have the mathematical.

62
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.100
Foundation

63
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.100
but let me at least give you a high level illustration.

64
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.100
Before we turn to the tutorial and we can talk about the

65
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.600
 mathematical.

66
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.300
syntax
