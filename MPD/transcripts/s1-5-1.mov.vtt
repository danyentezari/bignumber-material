00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
So I'm just going to show you a few things. So let's say

1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.200
 we have a variable called price.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.700
So this to 1,000?

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.100
and

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.900
next I will type in print.

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.600
prices is a very

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.100
simple example, but I just want to do this.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.700
To show you something in the slides.

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.800
Now when I declare this variable and I run it.

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.100
both of these things

10
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.100
will be put in temporary storage when the program is

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.400
 running.

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.300
Okay.

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.900
and when The Interpreter processes the

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.100
 line that comes right after it what it's going to do is it's going

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.100
 to

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.900
access the random access memory

17
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.300
to see to what this variable price

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.400
 is pointing and then print the contents of contents of that. Okay?

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.400
So very basic stuff.

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.200
Okay, but I'll tell you why I'm doing this.

21
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.600
So when we come back to the slides here.

22
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.200
Let's say this is you have a program and you've declared two vowels. You have

23
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.300
 a variable called price.

24
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.400
Whose value is 1,000 and the variable

25
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.300
 called user whose value is the string John?

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.200
Okay, so whatever you create your program.

27
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
During runtime will be put into temporary storage.

28
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.700
Okay, so

29
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.200
these are 100 and John or both

30
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.600
 data, but so are price and user.

31
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.200
now

32
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.500
what we also want to know is that every thing that

33
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 is putting temporary storage has associated with an address.

34
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.800
Okay.

35
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.500
and

36
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.300
we call these variables.

37
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.300
That's the value of the variable.

38
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.500
And we call these the pointers. So a pointer is an address

39
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.900
 in memory.

40
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.000
Okay.
