00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.800
The definition I am going to give you is based on.

1
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.000
What I have read?

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.800
In a very well-known book called The Princeton companion.

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.500
of mathematics

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.300
the Princeton companion to mathematics

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.300
In that book they say that there's not a clear

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.900
 distinction.

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.700
and it is

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.600
debatable as to what constitutes pure mathematics.

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.100
and what constitutes a plight mathematics and

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.200
 why I've

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.500
here to overlapping diagrams

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.500
But to keep it concise I will give

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.200
 you this definition.

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.300
First mathematics what is mathematics in

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.900
 its entirety?

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.100
One common definition is that mathematics is a language.

17
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.700
Just like English and German and Mandarin our

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.800
 languages mathematics 2 was a language.

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.900
The difference is mathematics is the language.

20
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.000
for expressing ideas, very precisely

21
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.800
Which is not true for other spoken languages.

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.500
So just like in English we have vocabulary and

23
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.600
 grammar rules.

24
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.300
We have vocabulary and rules in

25
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.000
 mathematics.

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.600
But it's a language. All right mathematics.

27
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100
Is a language and of course if you

28
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.000
 want you can also say it's a collection of ideas.

29
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
Collection are very brilliant ideas, of course all of them

30
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.900
 communicated in a language of precision.

31
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
What does that mean for applied and pure mathematics? What does it have to do with this

32
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.400
 discussion? Well Applied Mathematics is about how

33
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.600
 you use that language. It's about

34
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.000
 how you use this language?

35
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.300
to solve problems in the real world in the real physical

36
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.300
 world whether it is at the

37
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.800
Atomic level

38
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.700
or

39
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.400
in the you know

40
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.000
Cosmic level

41
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.500
whereas pure mathematics is about the language itself

42
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.100
 is the study of the language.

43
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800
So you're not using pure mathematics to?

44
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.200
you know send a rocket to

45
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.100
 Mars or at least that's not the direct intention rather

46
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.700
 it is to

47
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200
Define things for example in English.

48
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.500
 We might have a debate. What is a noun? What

49
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.100
 makes a pronoun what are the rules that award

50
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.500
 must follow in

51
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.200
 order for it to be considered an adjective? For example?

52
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.600
so

53
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.800
That's really it Applied. Mathematics is how you apply mathematics to

54
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.900
 solve a problem.

55
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.500
Like in physics or any of the engineering disciplines

56
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.200
 or computer science, whereas pure mathematics is

57
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.900
 about mathematics and its rules.

58
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.700
Now again, what does this have to do with?

59
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.600
discrete mathematics or programming

60
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.200
Again, I want to bring you back to what I said at the start of this.

61
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.200
session

62
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400
there are two obstacles.

63
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.600
to becoming proficient in mathematics

64
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.200
and you know, you don't need to you don't need me to convince you of

65
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.000
 this statement that if you are proficient in mathematics, it

66
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.500
 can be proficient anything and any

67
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.200
of the mathematical disciplines

68
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.900
whether it's physics.

69
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.700
economics

70
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.600
Data science, you name it?

71
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.500
If you know math.

72
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.000
Then you can do whatever you want.

73
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.600
but most of the time

74
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.100
people have

75
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.400
a sense of urgency about

76
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.500
solving particular problem and learning enough about this

77
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.400
 language. We call mathematics to the extent that

78
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.500
 allows them to solve the problem.

79
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.500
And they may not be no be too concerned about all of

80
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.800
 the symbols and terms and

81
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.700
 rules, you know, pedagogical and

82
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.500
 philosophical.

83
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.100
concerns

84
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.400
it'll just learn enough for to solve a

85
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.800
 particular problem. And this is a specially true for computer programs learn

86
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.700
 enough or learn the bare minimum

87
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.800
 just to be able to build an application or Implement a

88
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.100
 certain algorithm. The problem is when you have this approach.

89
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.000
You will.

90
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.300
Plateau very quickly, you'll you will

91
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.300
 make a lot of progress at the very beginning but then

92
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.300
 very soon you will.

93
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.100
You will Plateau you will get stuck. You will not be able to go

94
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.900
 very far.

95
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.200
And you know, there is a

96
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.900
wealth of information that is produced every

97
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.300
 day.

98
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.300
In the form of academic papers about solving

99
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.900
 all kinds of complex problems.

100
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.600
Let me say that again.

101
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.000
there is

102
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.500
in Academia a lot of great academic Papers

103
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.800
 written

104
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.500
About computer science and machine learning.

105
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.200
but

106
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.800
to the broader Community this information is

107
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.700
 not accessible.

108
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.300
And I don't mean it's not hard. It's not easy to get a hold of

109
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.400
 such a paper. I mean in the sense that it's not easy for them to read it

110
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.900
 and understand it.

111
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.000
because these papers

112
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.600
are

113
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.400
well, you know expressed a lot in mathem is

114
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.200
 a lot of mathematics explanation. And if you cannot read the ball,

115
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.300
 you won't be able to interpret you will not be able to interpret them. And if

116
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.800
 you're not able to interpret them, then you won't be able to implement them.

117
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.300
So, how do you stay ahead? How do you put yourself in

118
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.400
 a situation you where you can read any

119
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.200
Type of paper and you know stay ahead.

120
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.500
well

121
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.000
You want to pay more attention?

122
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.800
to the symbols to the rules

123
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.500
so you want to have the mentality of

124
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.100
someone in pure mathematics

125
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.100
if you learn the language early.

126
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.300
It will pay dividends in the future. You'll be

127
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.900
 able to progress a lot faster.

128
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.100
Than if you try to stumble along the way

129
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.800
 and learn whatever you can along the way.

130
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.500
All right. This is what this session is about and this

131
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.100
 is what the course is about.

132
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.500
It is about.

133
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.000
teaching you

134
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.200
the language properly

135
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.300
and teaching you to independently learn the

136
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.700
 language going forward.

137
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.700
All right.

138
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.700
That's enough with this section. Let's move on.
