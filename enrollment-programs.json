Although this course has Statistics and Probability Theory in the title, it contains sufficient supplementary material about other mathematical subjects that is necessary for mastery in Statistics and Probability Theory. <br/><br/>This course also teaches R, the programming language for statistical analysis. You will learn the required programming constructs to perform analysis in this specialized programming language. You will learn to apply the appropriate functions and methods, import and process data, produce meaningful visualizations, and interpret the results of analysis (e.g, Correlation, ANOVA, etc.)",
