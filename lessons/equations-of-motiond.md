# Equations of Motion

Here, we list the equations of motions first defined by Newton. Then, the extensions of these laws by Euler on rigid bodies.

The equations of motions, though they are from physics, have applications in analysis, especially in the fields of differential geometry and partial differential equations; for example, in partial differential equations, the equations of motion are the Euler-Lagrange equations.

The equations of motion describe the behavior of physical objects as they move through space and time. Here are some fundamental equations of motion in physics:

## Newton's Laws (for particles)

1. Position as a function of time (constant acceleration):
   $$x(t) = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

2. Velocity as a function of time (constant acceleration):
   $$v(t) = v_0 + at$$

3. Velocity-displacement relation (constant acceleration):
   $$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(x - x_0)$$

4. Average velocity:
   $$\bar{v} = \frac{x - x_0}{t}$$

5. Acceleration:
   $$a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$

6. Newton's Second Law of Motion:
   $$F = ma$$

7. Work-Energy Theorem:
   $$W = \Delta KE = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$$

8. Conservation of Mechanical Energy:
   $$KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f$$

## Euler's Laws (for rigid bodies)

9. Linear momentum:
   $$F = \frac{d}{dt}(mv)$$

10. Angular momentum:
    $$\tau = \frac{d}{dt}(I\omega)$$

Where:
- $x$: position
- $t$: time
- $v$: velocity
- $a$: acceleration
- $F$: force
- $m$: mass
- $W$: work
- $KE$: kinetic energy
- $PE$: potential energy
- $\tau$: torque
- $I$: moment of inertia
- $\omega$: angular velocity
- Subscript $0$ denotes initial values
- Subscripts $i$ and $f$ denote initial and final values respectively
