# The P-Value: Fisher's Definition

According to the International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science [1], Sir Ronald Fisher considered deviations in data grounds for rejecting the null hypothesis.

Here, by deviations, we mean standard deviations.

Fisher states [2],

*"Deviations exceeding twice the standard deviation are thus formally regarded as significant."*

The p-value is the probability of a getting an extreme result. 

If we follow Fisher's reasoning, extreme means getting a result that is at least two standard deviations away from the mean.

Note that in the International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science, it is also stated that *"the p-value is neither an objective nor very useful measure of evidence in statistical significance testing."*

If you are going to use p-values, then either reject or don't reject the null hypothesis. However, p-values are still not going to be very useful.
