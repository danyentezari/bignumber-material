# Abstract Algebra: A Quick Introduction

## Binary Operations
Mathematical operations (for example, arithmetic) that can be applied to elements in a set. Operators $+$ and $\times$ are both binary operators.

## Group
A group is a tuple $(G, *)$ to which these axioms apply:

1. Closure
   $$a * b \in S $$

2. Identity
   $$ a * i = i * a = a $$

3. Inverse
   $$a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = i$$

4. Associativity
   $$a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c $$

## Abelian Group
An Abelian Group is a group with axioms (1) to (4) and,

5. Commutativity
   $$a * b = b * a$$

## Ring
A set to which the following axioms apply:

1. Associativity
   $$ a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c $$

2. Commutativity
   $$a+b = b+c$$

3. Zero
   $$a+0 = 0$$

4. Additive Inverse
   $$a+(-a) = 0$$

5. Associativity (Multiplication)
   $$ (ab)c = a(bc) $$

6. Commutativity (Multiplication)
   $$ab = ba$$

7. Unity (or Multiplicative Inverse)
   $$a1 = a$$

8. Distributivity
   $$a(b+c)=a(b) + a(c)$$

## Integral Domain
A type of ring with axioms (1) to (8) but not (7).

## Field
A type of ring with axioms (1) to (8) and

9. Multiplicative Inverse
   $$a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = a$$
