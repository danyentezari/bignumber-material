**Example 1**: In a study comparing the effectiveness of three different teaching methods on student performance, a one-way ANOVA is used to test if there are significant differences in average test scores among the groups using each method.

**Example 2**: When examining the effects of two factors, such as drug dosage and time of administration, on patient recovery rates, a two-way ANOVA can be applied to assess the impact of each factor independently and their interaction effect on recovery rates.
