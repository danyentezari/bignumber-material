### Definitions

#### Bernoulli distribution: 
> Used to model a binary outcome where the probability of success (i.e., "1") is known or estimated, such as the probability of flipping heads or tails on a coin.

#### Binomial distribution: 
> Used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of trials with a known or estimated probability of success, such as the number of heads obtained in a fixed number of coin flips.

#### Geometric distribution: 
> Used to model the number of trials needed to get the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with a known or estimated probability of success, such as the number of coin flips needed to get the first head.

#### Negative Binomial distribution: 
> Used to model the number of failures that occur before a fixed number of successes are achieved in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with a known or estimated probability of success, such as the number of coin flips needed to get 5 heads.

#### Poisson distribution: 
> Used to model the number of occurrences of a rare event in a fixed interval of time or space, such as the number of car accidents in a day in a given city.

#### Zipf distribution: 
> Used to model the frequency of occurrence of words in natural languages, such as the frequency of words in a book.


#### Normal distribution (Gaussian distribution): 
> Used to model continuous data that follow a bell-shaped curve, such as the distribution of human heights or weights.

#### Student's t-distribution: 
> Used to estimate the mean of a population when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown, such as in medical research where a small number of patients are available for study.

#### Chi-squared distribution: 
> Used to test hypotheses about the variance of a normally distributed population, such as in quality control where the variance of a manufacturing process needs to be estimated.

#### F-distribution: 
> Used to test hypotheses about the equality of variances of two normally distributed populations, such as in comparing two manufacturing processes.

#### Uniform distribution: 
> Used to model a continuous variable where all values between two endpoints are equally likely, such as the time between buses arriving at a bus stop.

#### Exponential distribution: 
> Used to model the time between events that occur at a constant rate, such as the time between calls to a customer service center.

#### Gamma distribution: 
> Used to model the time until a certain number of events occur in a Poisson process, such as the time until a certain number of cars pass through a 
toll booth.

#### Beta distribution: 
> Used to model the probability of success in a Bernoulli trial where the success probability itself is uncertain, such as the probability that a new medication will be effective.

#### Cauchy distribution: 
> Used to model data with heavy tails, such as the distribution of waiting times in a queue where some customers take much longer than others to be served.

#### Log-normal distribution: 
> Used to model data that follow a normal distribution after taking the logarithm of the values, such as the distribution of incomes in a population.

#### Weibull distribution: 
> Used to model the time until a failure occurs in a system that has a decreasing or increasing hazard rate over time, such as the time until a light bulb fails.

#### Pareto distribution: 
> Used to model data with a power-law tail, such as the distribution of wealth in a society.

#### Rayleigh distribution: 
> Used to model the distribution of wind speeds or wave heights in a natural system, such as the distribution of wave heights in an ocean.
