# Measures of Dispersion

The measures of dispersion are numbers that represent the spread and variation in data,

The measures of dispersion are range, interquartile range, variance, and standard deviation; they are calculated as follows:

Consider this set of values:

$$X = \{ 3,3,3,4,6,8,8,9 \} $$

<br/>

Then, the measures are found as follows,

**Range**

The range is the difference between the smallest and largest values in $X$

range $ = 3 - 9 = 6$


<br/>

**Interquartile Range**

<br/>

**Variance**

<br/>

**Standard Deviation**
