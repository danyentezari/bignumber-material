# Module 1 Overview 

In module 1, we cover the basics of descriptive statistics. We go over numerical quantities that help us make sense about distributions such as central tendency, dispersion, standard deviation, and the interquartile range. We also learn about important mathematical notation that will help us to understand the formulas for both descriptive and inferential statistics.

We will also learn about some key concepts to which we will be making references throughout the course.

In particular, we put our focus on the most important topic of all: the concept of a *distribution*.
