# Variance and Standard Deviation

### Variance
Variance is a number that measures the extent to which values in a data deviate from the mean average.

### Standard Deviation

Standard Deviation is the square root of variance.

However, the standard deviation is useful when the distribution is symmetrical about the mean average and it is influenced by outliers.
