# Mathematical Notation

This course (as with other courses here) is designed to teach you as much of the mathematical notation as possible. In fact, if you had to choose one thing to really master in this course it should be the mathematical expressions; in particular, the meaning and context of mathematical symbols.

<br/>

Mathematics is a language with its own alphabet, vocabulary, and grammar.

If you study mathematics as a language instead of a set of formulas to be put to memory, you will very, very quickly make progress in your journey of learning mathematics and statistics.

In this section, we will go over some of the important mathematical symbols that you will see time and time again in statistics and probability theory (as well as mathematics as a whole).


### General Mathematics Conventions

We start with the letters of the English alphabet. It is converntion to use the first letters of the alphabet for constants, the last letters if the alphabet for variables, and the letters in the middle of the alphaebt for indexing. Specifically, the letter $n$ is used for any arbirtrary number.


| Concept | Characters |
|-|-|
| Constants | $a,b,c,...$ |
| Variables | $...,x,y,z$ |
| Indexing | $...,i,j,k,...$ |
| Arbitrary Number | $n$ |

### Set Theory Notation

A set is a collection of mathematical objects (e.g, numbers, functions, and other sets).


**Basic Example**

Set are represented with a pair of curly braces $\{ \}$. When naming a set, it is usually a convention to use an uppercase letter.

**Example 1** $$X = \{ 4,5,6,2,1,9 \}$$

<br/>

**Subset of a Set**
Here's a subset of $X$. Subsets can be named with any other uppercase letter or, more meaningfully, the same letter but with subscript.



**Example 2** $$X_1 = \{ 5,2 \}$$


<br/>

To express that $X_1$ is a subset of $X$, we use the subset symbol $\subset$.  

$$X_1 \subset X$$

<br/>


**Elements of a Set**

If a set is a collection of mathematical objects, then the mathematical objects of a set are called elements. If we wish to express that some object is an element of a set, the symbol $\in$ is used. This symbol is read "in".

**Example 3** When indicating that some value is an element in the set. 

$$4 \in X$$
$$6 \in X$$


**Example 4** When indicating a value by its index (position) in the set
$$x_1 \in X$$
$$x_2 \in X$$
$$x_n \in X$$


<br/>

**Cardinality of a Set**

The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in a set. The cardinality of a set is express with two vertical bars $||$.

**Example 5**
$$N = 6 = |X|$$
