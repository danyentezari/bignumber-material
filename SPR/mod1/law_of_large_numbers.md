# Law of Large Numbers

The law of large numbers states that as the size of a sample grows bigger, the sample statistics will tend to the parameters of the population from which it was drawn.

So, for example, when the size of the sample is increased more and more, the mean average of the sample will increasingly approach the mean average of the population.
