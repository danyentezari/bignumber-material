# Probability Distributions

A probability distribution is, as the name suggests, the distribution of probability across all observations.

Recall that probability is a number between 0 and 1. Therefore, in a probability distribution, all observations are assigned some fraction of 1.

### Discrete Probability Distribution

A discrete probability distribution is a distribution of probabilities for specific observations.

The distribution can be analyzed in two ways:
1- Table
2- Graph


Consider this example where the data is about the distribution for a pair of dice.

| Faces | Probability |
|-|-|
| 2 | 1/36 = 0.02 |
| 3 | 2/36 = 0.05 |
| 4 | 3/36 = 0.08 |
| 5 | 4/36 = 0.11 |
| 6 | 5/36 = 0.14 |
| 7 | 6/36 = 0.17 |
| 8 | 5/36 = 0.14 |
| 9 | 4/36 = 0.11 |
| 10 | 3/36 = 0.08 |
| 11 | 2/36 = 0.05 |
| 12 | 1/36 = 0.02 |

If the table is plotted as a graph, it would look like **Figure 4** below.

### Continuous Probability Distribution

A continuous probability distribution is a distribution of probabilities for a possibly infinite number of observations.
