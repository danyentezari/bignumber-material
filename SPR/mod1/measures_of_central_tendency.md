# Measures of Central Tendency

The measures of central tendency are numbers that represent the location of averages in the data.

The measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode; they are calculated as follows:

Consider this set of values

$$X = \{ 3,3,3,4,6,8,8,9 \} $$

<br/>

Then, the measures are found as follows,


**Median**

The number right in the center of $X$. Since there are an even number of values in $X$, we take the two number in the middle and take their average.

median $= \dfrac{4+6}{2} = 5$

<br/>

**Mode**

The most recurring number in $X$.

mode = $3$

<br/>

**Mean**

The mean is used to determine an absolute number by which to compare all other values in the data, With the mean, we can determine both (1) whether some value is above or below the average and (2) the degree of variation in the data.

Mean is related to variance (and standard deviation) which is covered in its own section

To calculate the mean average of $X$, sum all the values of $X$ and divide this sum by the number of values in $X$.

<br/>

mean = $ \dfrac{3+3+3+4+6+8+8+9}{8} = 5.5$
