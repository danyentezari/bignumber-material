# Parameters and Statistics

This section is an important continuation on the topic of mathematical notation.

In the subject of probability theory, and by extension statistics, the convention is to use specific characters for frequently statistics and parameters.

In **Table 4** below, the most commonly referenced symbols in probability theory and statistics are listed along with the pronunciation and the concepts to which each symbol refers.

<br/>

| Concept | Symbol | Pronunciation |
|-|-|-|
| Random Variable | $X$ | big x |
| Population Size | $N$ | big n|
| Sample Size | $n$ | small n |
| Population Mean | $\mu$ | mu |
| Sample Mean | $\bar{x}$ | bar x |
| Population Standard Deviation | $\sigma$ | sigma |
| Sample Standard Deviation | $s$ | s |
| Population Variance | $\sigma^2$ | sigma squared |
| Sample Variance | $s$ | s squared |
| Distribution<sup>[1]</sup> | $\sim$ | tilde |
| Parameter (general) | $\theta$ | small theta |
| Parameter space | $\Theta$ | big theta |

**Footnotes**
1. The symbol $\sim$ is a main verb; that is, it is part of an expression and not a mathematical object in and of itself. An example is this expression
$$ X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma) $$
which is read "X has normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.
