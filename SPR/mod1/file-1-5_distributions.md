# Distributions

The central focus of this course and, perhaps, all of statistics (and by extension, probability theory and machine learning) is the the concept of a distribution.

A distribution is a data that describes the frequency of observations.

Distributions come in different forms. Let us look at the basics first.

<br/>

### Frequency Distribution

Consider the following example. <br/>

Suppose we toss a fair dice 20 times and record the outcome.

After the 20 experiments have been performed, we count the frequency of each side and put the data in a table like so.


| Face | Frequency |
|-|-|
| 3 | 7 |
| 1 | 3  |
| 2 | 6 |
| 4 | 4 |

**Table 1: Frequency Distribution**

<br>

So, side 3 landed 7 times; side 1 landed 3 times...etc.

This is pretty straightforward, of course, but keep reading because this is the foundation for probability distributions!

<br/>

### Relative Frequency Distribution

A relative frequency distribution is one where the frequency of every observation is divided by the total. Look at the table below which has  changed **Table 1** from a frequency distribution to a relative frequency distribution.

| Face | Frequency |
|-|-|
| 3 | 0.35 |
| 1 | 0.15  |
| 2 | 0.30 |
| 4 | 0.20 |

**Table 2: Relative Frequency Distribution**

<br/>

To calculate relative frequency, you divide each frequency by the total number of outcomes. So, for example, $\dfrac{7}{20} = 0.35$.


The relative frequency distribution is advantageous because you can see more quickly which observations are the most (or least) frequent.

Of course, this could be better if graphed but that's for the next section.

### Probability Distribution

Statistics tells us that we can determine the probability of observations by looking at data â€“ like in the tables above.
