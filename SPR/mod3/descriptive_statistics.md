# Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics is one of the two stages of a statistical study. The other being inferential statistics.

Before we can make inferences on data, we must first have a description of it. More precisely, we need numerical descriptions of data. 

<br/>

Here's an example of what we mean by "numerical descriptions" of data:
- Mean average
- Variance
- Standard deviation

and so on. <br/>


Of course, you have already heard about these terms. However, we want to add some context here and set up oursleves for more the ability to make inferences on or find relationships in data.
