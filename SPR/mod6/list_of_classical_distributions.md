# List of Classical Distributions

1. **Short definition**: Common probability distributions used in statistics.

2. **Long definition**: Classical distributions are fundamental probability distributions used in statistical analysis. They describe the behavior of random variables and are essential in various applications, including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and estimation. Key classical distributions include:
   - **Normal Distribution**: Describes data clustered around a mean with a bell-shaped curve.
   - **Binomial Distribution**: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials with a constant probability of success.
   - **Poisson Distribution**: Represents the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space with a constant mean rate.
   - **Exponential Distribution**: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.
   - **Chi-Square Distribution**: Used in hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals for variance.
   - **t-Distribution**: Used in small-sample hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for means.
   - **F-Distribution**: Applied in comparing variances and ANOVA.

6. **Example 1**: In a manufacturing process, the number of defective items in a batch of 100 is modeled by a binomial distribution with $ n = 100 $ and probability $ p = 0.05 $. The binomial distribution calculates the probability of having exactly $ k $ defective items, where $ k $ can range from 0 to 100.

7. **Example 2**: A researcher measures the time until a radioactive atom decays and finds that the time follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 2 hours. The exponential distributionâ€™s PDF is:
   $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\lambda} e^{-\frac{x}{\lambda}}$$
   
   where $ \lambda = 2 $. The researcher can use this distribution to determine the probability of decay within a certain time frame.
