# Getting Started with Python

In this first section, you are going to learn the basics of the Python language:

1. Using the BigNumber IDE
2. Adding and removing comments
3. Running a built-in function


### Using the Code Editor

What you see in the top split of the right panel is a code editor. This is an app that helps you write algorithms in a script.

The lower split in the right panel is the console. This where you see the output of your algorithm.

Note:
This is a code editor designed specifically for your learning dashboard. In practice, you would need to install a (1) code editor and (2) a compiler.

### Working with Built-in Functions

In a later section, we will define what a function is and what properties they have.

In the meantime, consider a function to be something that allows you to run an algorithm that was written in advance.

### Tasks

1. Remove the `#` next to the `print()` function and run the script. If you see "Well done!" in the console, you have completed the first task.
