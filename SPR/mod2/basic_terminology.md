# Basic Terminology

In this section and the following sections, we're going to refer to some terms and it will be helpful if you (at least somewhat) know what they mean. 

Refer to this section whenever you forget what these words mean. You will eventually understand and remember what these are.

- Algorithm:
A set of instructions for the computer.

- Function:
The name for an algorithm written in advance. 
<i>Note: this is not the accurate definition. However, we will stick with this definiton for the time being.</i>

- Script:
A file in which algorithms are written.

- Binary:
A sequence of 1s and 0s. This is the "mother tongue" of a computer. Computers understand 1s and 0s becuase they directly translate to electronic signals in the computer's hardware.

- Compiler:
Software that converts Python to binary. Python is a human-readable programming language. For the computer to understand Python code, it must be converted (i.e, compiled) to binary so that the computer can actually process it.

- Comment:
Text written for a human user inside a script. Comments are ignored by compilers (unless told otherwise) and are akin to writing down notes on a piece of paper.
