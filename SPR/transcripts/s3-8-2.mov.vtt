00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.000
so this is our regression model and that what we want

1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.100
 to do is we want to assign it to assign it to a variable so

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.800
 we can say let's say

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
linear model

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.300
You can call it whatever you want.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.000
now let's

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.100
run this line of code

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.100
now there is a special function to plot.

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.300
The there's a special function that will take.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.100
your model

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.600
and

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.200
extract from it or the camera

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.800
 from it. It's slope. It's intercept and

13
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.200
Append appendellite on top

14
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.500
 of your current graph it will give us that that you

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.200
 know that visualization we're looking for. So if you want to see the

16
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.600
 contents of your model the summary of your model, there's a

17
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 function called summary.

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.800
passed with your model run it

19
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.800
And I will give you some information about your regression model now some

20
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.500
 of the things we haven't talked about like residuals.

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.100
the coefficients

22
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.900
it is significance levels and standard

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500
 error r squared F test F

24
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.400
 statistics I had slides on those.

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.600
but let's quickly run through them and

26
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.000
maybe we can touch how these also now to plot.

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.100
The regression line on top of

28
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.600
 this graph like just like put on top of it. There's

29
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.900
 a function called a b line.

30
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.000
It takes a multiple arguments, but the primary one is of course

31
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 the

32
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.800
the leading model itself

33
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.500
There's a function called.

34
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.600
coefficient

35
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
and you want to pass through with your linear model. I'll tell you I'll tell you

36
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 about arguments of this function.

37
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.500
in the second example

38
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.300
and the second argument is simply if you want to cut by

39
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.600
 default the color will be black but let's use red because

40
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.600
It will be the line will be clear.

41
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.700
Give it a color you can say, you know red.
