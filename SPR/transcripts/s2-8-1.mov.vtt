00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.700
So now let's jump into an exercise with

1
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.300
 the normal.

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.800
for a normal distribution

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.300
and this is

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.200
one problem that you can solve one such

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.200
 problem. You can solve if you understand.

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.600
the normal distribution

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.200
to solve our problem like this everything we've learned.

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.000
from day one

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.900
and

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.100
What we're going to learn today?

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.200
Is going to prepare you to solve.

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.000
most

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.000
of the problems you would find in a

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.400
 statistical or a textbook that has the with

15
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.900
 Statistics and probably Theory here's one.

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.400
It says that there are two machines for cutting

17
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.200
 quarks intended for years and white bottles.

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.800
Okay, so you have two machines that?

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.400
You know.

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.400
produce these quirks they would fit on a wine

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.500
 bottle the first

22
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.700
produces corks with diameters that are normally distributed

23
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.300
 with mean three centimeters and the standard

24
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.300
 deviation of

25
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.100
0.1 centimeter

26
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.300
Let's look at the second mission. The second machine produces corks with

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.500
 diameters that have normal distribution with 3.04. So

28
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.400
 almost the same as the

29
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.800
 first machine. However, it standard deviation is much

30
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.100
 smaller.

31
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.200
Let me stop you before I complete the last sentence

32
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.000
 the second machine. The second machine has a

33
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.400
 smaller standard deviation, which means if

34
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.100
 you look at its probability distribution, it's much narrower.

35
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.500
And like I said if it's much narrower.

36
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.200
It's let's likely to vary and so it's less prone

37
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.700
 to risk.

38
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.600
Let's prone to risk.

39
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.300
And last sentences acceptable Crooks have

40
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.000
 diameters between 2.9 centimeters or 3.1 centimeters. So

41
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.600
 you can't really deviate too much. You can't make corks that

42
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.900
 are too.

43
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.800
Big or too small it has to be.

44
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.700
You know between 2.9 to 3.1.

45
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.800
This question says we have two machines both of

46
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.900
 them.

47
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600
produce quarks

48
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.300
their mean is approximately the same or virtually

49
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.000
 the same mean.

50
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.400
Okay, when they when they counted.

51
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.300
Those quarks and they took it

52
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.200
 took a note of their diameter.

53
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.100
They realized that

54
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.300
the mean average the mean average

55
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.000
 of the corks.

56
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.200
Of the first machine and the mean average of the quirks of

57
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.800
 the second machine.

58
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.100
Is the same.

59
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.300
Like the meaning the on average, they're very similar on average.

60
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.200
 They're very similar. However one standard Devi one machine has

61
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.100
 a bigger standard deviation and they want to

62
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.400
 know

63
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.100
Is the standard deviation?

64
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.400
Too much for us. Like let's say you have this

65
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.100
 you have to choose between two machines. Let's say one is cheaper than

66
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.300
 the other.

67
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.800
the first machine is cheaper, but

68
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.100
it's more susceptible to variation.

69
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.600
Now if it varies too much, that means you cannot ship

70
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.200
 those corks.

71
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.100
So you end up with more waste and you have

72
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.400
 to do such should be pay more and get the second machine which has smaller standard

73
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.200
 deviation or no the first machine that

74
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200
 has more standard deviation. It won't be too bad

75
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.900
 like

76
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.600
Perhaps it has a high enough probability that

77
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.700
 it's worth the risk.

78
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.700
So, how do we decide how do we use statistics?

79
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.500
To arrive at this answer can

80
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.700
 we should buy the first machine or no? It's

81
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.600
too risky. Let's let's go in the second machine. Okay, so I'm already

82
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.200
 giving you the answer by the way. It says which machine is more likely to produce an

83
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.300
 acceptable work. The answer is the second machine, but let's see how we can determine this

84
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.400
 answer.

85
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.500
using the CDF

86
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.400
using the normal distribution and using the standardized random

87
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.700
 variable.
