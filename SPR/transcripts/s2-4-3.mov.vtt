00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.600
This equals sign shouldn't be here by the way, that's a mistake.

1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.900
 But here they're asking.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.900
in the first in the first

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.000
here's how they are translating this.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.600
problem

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.300
with the mathematical rotation

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.300
fee of

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.700
this question the P of this question.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
X is within one standard deviation of its me

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.700
Okay, so we have two terms here standard deviation

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.100
 and mean mean of course is the

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.600
 center.

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.400
of

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.300
the probability distribution

14
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900
We said that there are three ways to

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.300
 measure averages we

16
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.500
 have.

17
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.800
mean

18
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.800
median mode but the most important one of them is

19
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.600
 is the mean that's where you take.

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.600
all the numbers

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.400
of the

22
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.800
random variable

23
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.500
add them up and then divide them by.

24
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.500
the amount

25
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.200
the quantity of those values when the random variable I'll show

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 you the equation if necessary.

27
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700
But what they're asking is.

28
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.600
What is the probability?

29
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.300
That X is within one standard deviation of its mean.

30
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.000
Let me stop right here and take you to.

31
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.200
the example with the

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
discrete normal distribution so we can revisit

33
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.000
so we can revisit the

34
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.400
the idea of the probability Mass function and it

35
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.200
 will jump back to this.

36
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Three right now you're looking at three.

37
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.500
notations

38
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300
the first one I told you about it whenever you see an uppercase

39
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.500
 letter.

40
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.400
In statistics you're looking at a random variable.

41
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800
now other letters can be used but

42
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.300
predominantly X is going to be used.

43
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.500
So if you look at this notation up

44
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.600
 here.

45
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.800
This is something we're looking at for the first time.

46
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.100
This is red in the following way. We say

47
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.600
 X.

48
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.500
The random variable has that's what

49
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.600
 this.

50
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.200
Till they sign means.

51
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.500
has

52
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.500
normal distribution

53
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.800
That's what the N means.

54
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.500
okay, don't confuse that uppercase and with a random

55
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.800
 variable because this is actually n

56
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.300
What parentheses?

57
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.600
Okay. So were you saying the random variable X has

58
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.700
 normal distribution?

59
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.200
At with this mean and this variance.

60
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.400
Okay, the first argument is the mean the second argument

61
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.100
 is the variance.
