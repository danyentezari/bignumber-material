00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.500
And in this exercise, I'm giving you I'm

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.100
 Gonna Give You hints.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.300
along the way

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.900
this exercise is going to give us a problem.

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.100
And it will ask us to provide both.

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.400
the pmf

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.800
also known as a probability distribution and the CDF.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.200
For this particular problem. Let's see what it says.

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.500
So here in this example we get to

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.400
Look at random variable. Pmf and CDF. Let

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.200
 X be the number of patients who visit a

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.500
 specialized Clinic during offers hours on some

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.900
 particular day.

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.500
So again when you when you see an uppercase letter.

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.800
in statistics and probability of theory they're talking about

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.900
a random variable

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.200
So this random variable trying to

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.700
 think of a table?

18
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.600
This table contains the number of patients who visit.

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
a clinic during office hours one Patient to

20
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.100
 Patient three patients on

21
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.800
for this random variable X. The only possible values are 0

22
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.800
 1 2 3 and 4.

23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
That means you can have up to four patients visiting that clinic it

24
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 won't be.

25
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.300
And more than that.

26
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.200
So if you look at the table of the random variable, you would have

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.600
 zero one two, three and four.

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.700
With probabilities point three point 25 Point

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.400
 20 point 50. So for example, what is the probability that

30
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.300
 zero patients show up?

31
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.100
point three point

32
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.400
Point 30 like 30% chance no one who shows up and what is

33
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.100
 the probability that for patients show up Point 15?

34
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.600
Oh like 15%

35
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.800
now

36
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.800
the question asks

37
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.900
What is P4?

38
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.400
what is the probability of

39
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.800
The fourth value of the random variable by the way, I mean the mistake.

40
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.600
50% is for three not four we

41
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.500
 have to find out for

42
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.400
so basically we have a table.

43
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.900
two columns

44
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.600
column one has

45
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100
five values zero one two, three and four like the number

46
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.000
 of patients you can have

47
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.000
Column two however has four.

48
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.200
the last one

49
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
Like the probability for when the I have

50
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.800
 four patients, that's something you have the calculate.

51
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.100
So let's focus on question. Number one, we'll spend five minutes on

52
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.200
 this problem 5 or 10 minutes on this problem.

53
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.600
Here's a hint for X problem. Number one.

54
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.600
Then the probability number the number probability.

55
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.100
Is somewhere between zero.

56
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.900
and one

57
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.000
for this one you don't have to do CDF or pmf.

58
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.700
Just figure out basic arithmetic.

59
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.500
Okay.

60
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.600
Here's another hint add them up.

61
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.100
First of all, add these up and see how what they add up to.

62
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.900
and remember that

63
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.000
probably can go all the way up to one.
