00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.900
Let me give you a small

1
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.200
 help.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.100
That will help you. Think about this.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.400
Think about the solution for this problem.

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.400
So I'm going to add example 2.

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.500
This is for random variables. So

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.700
look how much we've covered so far.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.500
We're making great progress So This Is Random.

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.900
variable

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.400
and now we are example number two.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.500
Okay, but here's what example one was like.

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.900
so this was the random variable of

12
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.400
example 1

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.300
so we had let's say we had some seed.

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.100
Okay.

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.200
This is some ID. This is not a number. That's nothing mathematical just

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.500
 ID.

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.400
and if this seat was

18
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.600
empty

19
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.600
you would get a one.

20
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.200
And then this one.

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.600
is let's say with ID for

22
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.300
and it's also assigned.

23
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.600
Meaning it's not vacant. So we have to find the third seat.

24
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.500
Okay.

25
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.400
If you want to that's sorry.

26
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.400
 This was supposed to be zero. Let's say there are only three seats.

27
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.300
so this is one this is one feature of the random variable you give

28
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.800
 it a

29
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.200
the value Within

30
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.600
a table like it is an actual table.

31
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
Well, we don't have a diagram for but it is a table and I

32
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.700
 will give you.

33
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.600
it's

34
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.000
probably now we'll count that in a second.

35
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.500
 Just bear with me but let me just go ahead and show you the solution for example

36
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.900
 two.

37
00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.800
Okay.

38
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.100
And then you will be able to solve a problem like this.

39
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.400
so

40
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.700
similar to the previous example, we had y

41
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.800
and we passed to the seat and it would give us the

42
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.000
a corresponding value

43
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100
Here rather we are talking about.

44
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.500
the number of values

45
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.000
the number of values

46
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.800
within the table of the random variable.

47
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.000
Okay.

48
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.500
Very simple. Here's how you do it.

49
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.300
S is your experiment?

50
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.200
This is the experiment anything that goes between the parentheses is

51
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.000
 the experiment like in the previous example, we had the seat ID. That's the

52
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.800
 ID was the experiment.

53
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.400
You are checking for that seat your experimenting

54
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400
 on that seat.

55
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.800
And you want to count.

56
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.200
the total number of chargers

57
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.700
And here's the notation. This is the experiment and that experiment.

58
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.400
translates into this data point

59
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.400
two and three

60
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.300
This is for station one. This is for station two.

61
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.400
Simply the arithmetic and that's what you get.

62
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.500
so on this experiment

63
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.600
at that particular point in time at those both stations the total

64
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.900
 number of charges that were being used.

65
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.400
Or five problem. Number two the difference

66
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.200
 between the total number of charges in use and Station 1

67
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.100
 versus Station 2.

68
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.700
So two charges are used are being used.

69
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.200
At Station 1 3 charges are being used as Station 3.

70
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 Excuse me.

71
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.500
Two charges are being used at station one.

72
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.800
three charges I've been used as Station to

73
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.100
random variable y

74
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.800
will tell you the difference between the two.

75
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.600
Now we will get minus 1.

76
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.400
You understand the difference is one like if

77
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400
 we take the absolute value of this number, it will be 1.

78
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.900
And this one is a mistake. This is supposed to be easy.

79
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.700
Okay. So ignore this is supposed to be Z.

80
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.500
uh Z the third random variable Z

81
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.400
says what is the maximum number of charges in

82
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.400
 active use at both stations for this

83
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.200
 particular experiment?

84
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.500
Again, we come back to the random Bible notation.

85
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.600
This is supposed to PC. So excuse the mistake Z of

86
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.500
 s equals z.

87
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.300
And let's say you had a function that would give

88
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.300
 you the maximum of the two.

89
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.000
So you would give it.

90
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.300
Four and one it will tell you that it's four. If you give it three

91
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.000
 and five it will give you five. Here's only going to give you

92
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.800
 three because obviously three is greater

93
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.000
 than greater than two.

94
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.500
Now here's what I meant when I said the random variable.

95
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.100
Is a table.

96
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.200
the random variable

97
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.800
before I talk about this exercise.

98
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.100
the random variable

99
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.600
and

100
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.700
the thing it's coupled with always the probability distribution.

101
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.200
 Keep these try to focus on these two

102
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.400
 words random violent property distribution together, they form

103
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.300
 an important table.

104
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.000
Or on the a table with two columns.

105
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.000
On the on the First Column you have the values.

106
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.800
That it did random variable can take and in the

107
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.500
 second column. You have the probability of each

108
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.000
 value.

109
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.300
So for example, if you were talking about flipping a coin.

110
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.900
You have the table would look like this you would have.

111
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.900
a table with four cells

112
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.200
The left column you would have head and tail.

113
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.800
head and tail are the values that the random variable can take

114
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.700
On the other column we would have 0.5 why because

115
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.200
 the probability of either one of those values would

116
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.100
 be 0.5.

117
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.900
50%

118
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.700
Okay, and we're working our way towards a more

119
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.700
 sophisticated table most sophisticated random variable.

120
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.800
Here's an example.

121
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.100
Concrete beam. Let's say you're in manufacturing.

122
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.000
Concrete Construction equip Construction

123
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.800
equipment

124
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.200
a concrete beam May Fail either by sheer

125
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.700
or flexure

126
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.300
There are two things that can make a concrete beam unusable.

127
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.400
Sheer reflection never mind. If you don't know what it what

128
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.000
 these two words mean, but if if

129
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.300
The Experience she reflection they cannot be using in the in

130
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.700
 the building

131
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.300
suppose that three failed beams are randomly selected.

132
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.700
And the type of failure is determined by each one. Let X

133
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.400
 be the number of beams among the three selected that

134
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400
 failed by shear.

135
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.700
So here's what we need to do.

136
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.400
We have a random variable.

137
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.800
a table

138
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.400
that contains the number of beams that

139
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.800
 have failed.

140
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.400
specifically by sheer

141
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.500
to have a random variable now we need

142
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.100
 to list.

143
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.300
these sample space

144
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.900
correspond and its corresponding outcome in the random variable.

145
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.000
So here's what I'm talking about.

146
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.300
Here's what the random variable minus. Here's what

147
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.200
 the random variable would look like minus the probability distribution.

148
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.100
Okay, we're not we haven't company probably probability distribution

149
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.300
 yet.

150
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.400
Okay, here's what I mean by random variables though is a

151
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:00.500
 table.

152
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.200
you have

153
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.300
the obviously the letter F stands for flexure.

154
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.100
and as for sheer

155
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.100
the random variable

156
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.500
it contains the number of the three

157
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.500
 failed beams.

158
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.400
the three field beams

159
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.300
and

160
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.600
the number of them that failed by the sheer

161
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.100
or a portion of it breaks apart.

162
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:38.700
for example

163
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.300
the first set of three failed beams

164
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.300
have all failed by flexure.

165
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.900
They have been bent Beyond taking beyond

166
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.400
 their usability.

167
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.500
The random variable will tell you that the number

168
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.000
 of shears in these three beams is

169
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.100
 zero. None of them fail by sheer.

170
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.400
all of them failed by F which stands for flexure

171
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.500
and then you and then you pick and then you go through another pair of

172
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.700
 three beams you pick them up.

173
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.800
And you find that two of them have failed by flexure.

174
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.500
 One of them has failed because they have issue. They

175
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.600
 have a big break.

176
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.300
The random variable will tell you one.

177
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.200
once you

178
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.300
and this is how you construct the table.

179
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.300
for the random variable

180
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.800
Okay, let's move quickly move on to the next one.

181
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.200
So we've looked at.

182
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.700
the first component

183
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.000
like the first part of the most important component the random value in the public distribution the
