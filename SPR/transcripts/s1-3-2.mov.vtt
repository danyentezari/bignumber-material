00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.200
now the problem when you are trying to do this when you're trying to

1
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.700
estimate

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.200
and guess

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.500
Something right? Because again what's statistics in many

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.800
 cases? We won't have or we won't have

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.600
all the data we need so we have to guess.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200
What that data will be?

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.700
our big obstacle we uncertainty

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.400
How can we be certain that what we're looking at or what we are guessing is accurate.

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.000
this is where

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.600
Can anyone guess?

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.000
this is where

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.000
probability here comes in.

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.300
so test statistics

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.000
is this

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.300
this is science.

16
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.100
Of trying to figure things out about populations and

17
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.600
 samples.

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
But you have one weakness. You have a major flaw in what you

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.200
 in we have a big problem when you're trying to

20
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.400
 do this and that's uncertainty this is where probabilities here comes in. It's the

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.900
 science of uncertainty.

22
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.700
techniques for figuring out

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.800
or dealing with risk and uncertainty and

24
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.200
 chance.

25
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.000
and measuring

26
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.100
House and did to help you determine how

27
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.500
 certain you can be. This is where probably Theory comes in.

28
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.100
And that's why these two are often paired together. And in fact,

29
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.000
 they share a lot of

30
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400
mathematical Concepts

31
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.500
okay, so this was a motivating reason for you to

32
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.600
want to learn the

33
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000
the concepts the mathematical notation

34
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.800
of these two fields in Greater detail

35
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.000
Okay.

36
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
Now where does our fit in the picture what are allows

37
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.600
 us to?

38
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.700
Employ the power of computers and

39
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.000
 especially computer programming.

40
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.900
to

41
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.900
make it easier for us to solve.

42
00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.800
until you know

43
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.200
solve the mathematical problems because the mathematics can be quite

44
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.100
what do you call it?

45
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.200
time consuming

46
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.800
If you have to do it by hand, and so that's where R. The

47
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.200
 programmers are comes into comes into play.
