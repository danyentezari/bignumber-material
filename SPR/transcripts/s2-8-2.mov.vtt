00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.600
so first of all

1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's Express.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.100
these two machines mathematically

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.600
So now we are looking at exercise 1.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.400
So this is

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.800
normal distribution

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.000
distribution

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.200
exercise one

8
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.700
it says

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.400
the first

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.100
machine

11
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.500
has mean of three centimeters.

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.800
standard deviation of 0.1 centimeters to express

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600
 this mathematically you say

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.500
that your random variable we would use x we

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.900
 would use x sub 1 so we have two machines.

16
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.300
Both machines produce corrects, so they will have experiments

17
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.900
 every time they produce a quirk right they're

18
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.800
 producing. That's an experiment.

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.600
That's an experiment. So we will use a random variable to represent both

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.100
 machines.

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.500
Since we have two we will use x sub 1 except two, you can use any random variable,

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100
 but we will just since X is used most

23
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.300
 often and I want you to become familiar with the notation. We will use x

24
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.000
 sub 1 and x sub 2 so x sub 1

25
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.500
okay has

26
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.900
That's what this.

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.000
Till they looking character means has normal

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 distribution.

29
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.300
3

30
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.700
And or was its divisions 0.1?

31
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.000
This is the first machine.

32
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.200
It's mean is three. It's standard deviation point one.

33
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.300
the other machine what you will represent using x sub 2

34
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.800
has normal distribution of

35
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700
3.04

36
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.400
and

37
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.600
standard deviation of 0.02

38
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.700
Okay, so it's mean the the second machine the

39
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.300
 second machine.

40
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.400
Okay.

41
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.000
it's a mean is towards the

42
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.400
towards the upper limit. So if you're looking at the numerically

43
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.600
 and you go, oh my goodness the second the mean it

44
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.100
 tends to have bigger bigger diameters. If

45
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.600
 you're just looking at the mean on the other hand, the standard deviation is much narrow.

46
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.400
So it's less likely to deviate. Okay, just by looking just like

47
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
 by looking at this notation you can you can figure out something you can

48
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.300
 approximate something whereas the first machine is

49
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.800
 right on three. It's like right in the center.

50
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.800
between 2.9 and 3.1

51
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.400
but it's standard deviation is

52
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.100
Greater at least when you compare it to

53
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.700
 the second machine.

54
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.000
So this can clue you in on.

55
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.900
It's not enough for you to get a decide to.

56
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.600
Library conclusive answer but

57
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.900
If you know this notation.

58
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.800
That can give away a lot of information already.

59
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.500
Okay.

60
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.300
So x sub 1 and x sub 2 this is

61
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.200
 the first machine second machine.

62
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.600
Now the next thing we want to look at.

63
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.100
We need to.

64
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.600
plot here

65
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.400
the other two pieces of information everybody that have

66
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.900
 been that has been given to us is this

67
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.600
acceptable quirks have diameters between

68
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.900
2.9 centimeters and 3.1 centimeters so

69
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.900
 we have to use this information.

70
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.300
For our standardized number valuable. So once we

71
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.000
 will take x sub 1 x sub 2 standardize them.

72
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.300
And then see if the if they're experiments will

73
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.300
 fall between 2.9 and 3.1. So let's assign these

74
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.000
 two values to two constants.

75
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.300
So we'll come back.

76
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.300
You will let a

77
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.300
equal to 2.9.

78
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.400
and we will let actually let's put in the same place and let's

79
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.100
 let B

80
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900
equals to equal to 3.1

81
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.400
Okay, so after standardizing.

82
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.000
these random variables

83
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.300
We want them to fall between either 2.9 or 3 3.1 and

84
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.700
 we want to know how many of their experiments will

85
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.100
 fall within this range.
