00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.100
Let's look at an example where we have.

1
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.300
Actual elements. I'm going to pull up

2
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.200
 the previous diagram so

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.900
Let's look at this from a different perspective.

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's say, you know Universal set. We also had.

5
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.600
our Universal set has the letters a through I

6
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.200
a b c d e r n z a

7
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.500
D E. F G H are in B

8
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.900
 and I is just out on so

9
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.400
if we take the complement of set a

10
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.000
we will discard a b c.

11
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.800
But d and e get to stay because what DNA

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.100
 also exists in set B.

13
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
in addition to the letter i

14
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.100
because that's in the Universal set.

15
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.700
If we take the complement of set B.

16
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.700
So he has D E F G H. Yes, but D

17
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.800
 and E are inside a so we get.

18
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.600
if sorry d

19
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.100
e

20
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.200
a b

21
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.300
c and the letter i

22
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.000
d e because well

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.300
the audience at a ABC and the letter

24
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.500
 i

25
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.400
from the universal set

26
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.600
notice

27
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.300
Oh we have here.

28
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.400
How many elements do these have in common?

29
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.300
I mean if put differently what is intersection of

30
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.400
 not a and not be

31
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.700
what it is intersection of these two sets.

32
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.300
so that would give us

33
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.800
d e

34
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.300
and I

35
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.000
in other words when we take the intersection

36
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.400
of the complements of A and B.

37
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.000
We will get the universal set. Excuse me,

38
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.100
 the one element outside in the

39
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.000
 Universal set.

40
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.700
Plus the elements that they have in common.

41
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.000
If we had taken the intersection of A and B.

42
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.700
If we had taken the intersection of A and B.

43
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.600
We would have gotten.

44
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400
D and E

45
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.200
only the elements they have in common.

46
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.700
But when you take the intersection of the complement of a and the

47
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.200
 complement of B, you will get the elements that

48
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.500
 they have in common Plus.

49
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.400
the element out in the Universal set

50
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.300
Now, let's go back up to what we had before.

51
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.100
and return to our table containing the

52
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.000
 joint and

53
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.600
marginal frequencies

54
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.200
A and B together have five elements.

55
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.600
But when you take the intersection of complement of

56
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.300
 a and complement of B, you will take the 5

57
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.600
 that they haven't come in plus the 25 that live

58
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.800
 outside.

59
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.400
I've set A and B the 25 5 plus

60
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.900
 25 that gives us 30.

61
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.300
And that's how we get what we get over here.

62
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.600
Now we have a table containing.

63
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.900
The Joint frequencies and the marginal frequencies.

64
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.900
 Well we are going to do next is turn

65
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.700
 these frequencies into relative

66
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.200
 frequencies.

67
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.400
When we do this, this will become analogous.

68
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.100
two probability

69
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.900
We can use relative frequency to get to probability. Once we

70
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.500
 go from the frequency to relative frequency, then

71
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.200
 we can talk about.

72
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.500
Conditional and Joint probabilities, so

73
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.600
 that's what we will get next.
