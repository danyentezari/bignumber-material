00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.200
The probability function which here now is expressed as a

1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.800
 map again using map rotation right colon arrows

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.200
 when you see these characters, this is this

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.500
 is a map.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.900
the probability function will map

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.500
the random variable

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.500
which is it which is itself a representation of

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.800
events

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.700
It will map.

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.300
The random variable the values in random variable these

10
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.000
 ones and zeros.

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.000
to the set

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.900
of values between 0 and 1

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
Inclusive of zero, so this is what we call a

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.400
 closed interval. Which means

15
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.700
Any value on X can take on any number from 0 to

16
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.100
 1.

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
And that's what probability is Right probability. We said is a

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.200
 number between 0 1 so probably the outcome of maybe I

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.100
 used the word outcome the result of a probability function.

20
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.300
Is probability which we set as

21
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 a number between 0 and 1?

22
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.600
Now let me talk. Let me show you that notation. I

23
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.200
 told you about which means something but it is

24
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.800
 not explicit.

25
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.500
So you might see something that looks like this.

26
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.800
This is read the probability that X.

27
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.400
Will be equal to 1.

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.000
What this really means?

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.700
or this is a short hand notation for

30
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.300
this over here.

31
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.100
We are saying what is the probability of

32
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.400
the set

33
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.300
notice the curly brackets

34
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.900
So we have the outermost parentheses because the outermost parentheses.

35
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.400
Means that P is a function, which is what we said.

36
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.300
P is a function. Yes probability is a function. The probability

37
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.800
 function is a function.

38
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.000
Which means it will take.

39
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.200
An element and give you another value.

40
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.700
So it will take a set.

41
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.700
the set has one element a

42
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.200
such that this vertical bar means such that.

43
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.000
When we plug in a inside X it

44
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.800
 gives us one.

45
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.300
Let me say let me say that again.

46
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.000
What is the probability?

47
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.800
Of the set that contains a such that

48
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.100
 when we take that when we take a plug it

49
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.100
 into X we get one.

50
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.300
now a is an element in capital a

51
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.400
So it's the outcome of the event a what did we say a is?

52
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.900
head to heads Tails tails

53
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800
What is that element?

54
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600
Then when you put inside X will give you one.

55
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.300
What is the element when you put inside X will make

56
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.600
 it 1?

57
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.200
It's heads.

58
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.200
If you put heads the outcome heads.

59
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.100
Inside the function X you will get a one.

60
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.600
now based on your background and

61
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.200
Why you are taking this course?

62
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.400
This could either be relevant or not.

63
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.200
at a later point

64
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.400
At a later point in time when you've covered much of this

65
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.400
 course, this might be relevant. But when

66
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.100
 you watch the subsequent videos in this

67
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.500
 course

68
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.600
And should you wonder what this notation

69
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.500
 is and how our random variables related to

70
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.000
 events?

71
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.500
You may want to come back to this video.
