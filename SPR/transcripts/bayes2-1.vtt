00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.200
Okay, so we get this diagram.

1
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.100
containing

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.600
set a

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.600
set B

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.400
which have 65 elements and 10 elements respectively.

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.200
And you have 25 elements that are not

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.500
 even in these sets. They're outside of the set.

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.100
So if I can say that again, we have 100 elements.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.200
in the Universal set so this

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.400
Let this rectangle this white figure.

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.000
represent all 100 elements

11
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.600
in this Universal set 65 of

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.400
 those elements will go into set a 10 of

13
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.100
 those elements will go into set B and the remaining 25 will live

14
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 outside of a and b

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.400
this space here in the Middle with the number five minute.

16
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.300
 I've kind of made it.

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.800
Great this time.

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.000
because this is the

19
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.000
because this is the intersection of A and B.

20
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.600
So five from a go in here and five

21
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.000
 from B.

22
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.500
going there

23
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.600
so if you were to

24
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
remove the set from the figure.

25
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.100
It would have all the 60 elements B would have only

26
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.700
 five elements.

27
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.000
Okay.

28
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400
Now, let me tell you about the cardinality.

29
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.900
This is simple concept cardinality is the size.

30
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.800
Of a set how many elements we have in a set mathematically we

31
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.100
 express this with two vertical bars as you can see

32
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.300
 here. So the cardinality of U is 100.

33
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.600
Cardinality of a 65 and then for B is

34
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.700
 10.

35
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.500
Okay.

36
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.100
So there's another 25 which live outside of a and b.

37
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.300
So here we have the

38
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.500
table

39
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.000
containing the marginal frequency

40
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.200
and the joint frequency

41
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.600
By frequency we mean count.

42
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.400
By module, we mean how much a set has on its

43
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.700
 own and by joint obviously.

44
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.900
We'll talk about the union of those two sets.

45
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.200
So

46
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.500
set a and b

47
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.200
set a and b

48
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.100
have five elements and cut in common.

49
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.600
Now the way you want to read this table.

50
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.600
Is First Column wise?

51
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.500
column wise has to do with set a so our focus

52
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.400
 is set a

53
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.200
in the second column we have what we call the complement of a that

54
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.900
 till they symbol that is complement complement means

55
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.600
 that which is not in set a

56
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.600
so the columns have to do with say the rows obviously set

57
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.900
 B.

58
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.200
So again A and B.

59
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.500
Have five elements in common.

60
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.100
a and not b

61
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.400
We have 60 elements y60 elements.

62
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.000
Set a has 65 but five of those.

63
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.600
Are shared with set B.

64
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.600
We want the number of elements that are unique to

65
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.300
 set a

66
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.800
So that's 60.

67
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.600
And of course if we add up these two numbers we get

68
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.800
 the original 65.

69
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.300
So irrespective of whether a shares those elements or

70
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.200
 not 65 is the total frequency.

71
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.100
That is the cardinality of the set.

72
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.200
And you can see it's the same for set B.

73
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.200
B has five elements in common with a

74
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.900
but if we would take set B, excluding the

75
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.300
 elements that it hasn't common with set a

76
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.600
 would get 5 again add does to get add up these

77
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.100
 two sums.

78
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.000
We get 10 again. That's the original frequency of set B.

79
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.400
Now let's talk about the complements.

80
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.600
Not a not b

81
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.800
it gives us 30.

82
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.400
Why is that the case? Well, let's see. Well

83
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400
 as the 5 in here plus the 25 out here.

84
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.200
Just before I show you why that is the case. Just notice that

85
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.400
 when we do sum up.

86
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.300
the frequencies in the margins of this table

87
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.700
We get a hundred so 10 plus 9 gives us 165

88
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.100
 plus 35 gives us a hundred. We're going

89
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.900
 to talk about marginal probability.

90
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.600
In a moment.

91
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.000
Just so you know, this is where that would comes from.

92
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.000
the margins of the table so four Bayesian

93
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.200
probability when we are counting the odds and the

94
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.500
 likelihood

95
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.800
the odds will involve the marginal probabilities.

96
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.900
the likelihood the conditional probabilities

97
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.200
the numbers we will get for these terms will come from a table that looks

98
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.600
 like this.

99
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.400
So we will literally get those numbers from the margins, but let's

100
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.000
 carry on.

101
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.500
Let me first make the case for the compliment.

102
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.900
The intersection the intersection of the complement of

103
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.900
 a and complement of B.
