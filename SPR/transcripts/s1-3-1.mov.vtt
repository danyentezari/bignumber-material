00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
Now, let's try to understand.

1
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.600
What's statistics is about?

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.100
at the high level

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.000
without looking at any formulas

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.000
So remember I said we will begin with two key terms.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.300
The word population and the word sample the goal

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.900
 of statistics.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.200
is to

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.300
Try to understand.

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.000
something about

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700
something we call a population by looking at

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.100
a subset

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.200
of that population, for example

13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.700
Let's say you want to know.

14
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.800
How many people live in?

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.200
an urban area

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.200
Let's say you want to you you're looking

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
 at a city within a certain country and you want to know what is the population of that

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.600
 country?

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.700
now usually

20
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.000
Governments, if they do a good job, they have

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.300
 something called a census. That means they know everything about all of their people.

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.200
Where they live?

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.600
How much they make and that kind of thing.

24
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.000
But assuming you don't know exactly.

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.500
You mean you don't have you don't have a database of all of the citizens?

26
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.100
In that City and you have to figure out how many people live there.

27
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.500
now

28
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.600
it's not always possible for you

29
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.500
 to show up of everyone's door.

30
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.800
Go and say hey, we want to count how many people are in this house and

31
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.900
 you start counting them and writing them down.

32
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.800
Oh what you can do.

33
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.900
Is you take?

34
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.900
a part of that City

35
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.300
I can't neighborhood.

36
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.400
And you do your best account everyone in that

37
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.500
 neighborhood.

38
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.400
Okay, like you look at.

39
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.300
The house in which they live how many people live in

40
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.800
 that house?

41
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.600
And you would take that and you take some of those houses in that

42
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.200
 neighborhood and you say okay two story building

43
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 four on average four people can

44
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.700
 live in that house.

45
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.700
Then you look at the houses in a

46
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.100
closed neighborhood

47
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.500
and how is it in a neighborhood a little farther from that and you

48
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.200
 think to yourself? Okay.

49
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.000
If in that neighborhood that we counted.

50
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.500
on average of

51
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.400
You know 200 people were living in that neighborhood.

52
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.600
Then we can use the power of statistics.

53
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.700
to estimate

54
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.200
how many people will be living in those in that

55
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.700
 neighborhood in that neighborhood in that neighborhood? Okay. I'm trying

56
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.500
 to really simple it make it simple for you.

57
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.200
 My point is this you take a sample a subset

58
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.900
 of the entire population and use that?

59
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.900
to determine this the entirety of the population

60
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.800
This is the this is the power of Statistics. It allows you to look

61
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.600
 at a sample a small piece.

62
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.900
of the puzzle

63
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.900
and then predict

64
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.000
What the entire picture looks like?

65
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.800
Okay, that's a very rudimentary definition of

66
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500
What statistics is trying to achieve?
