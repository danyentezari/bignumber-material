now

1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.100
what we are going to look at next.

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.800
Is an application of the Bayesian?

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.800
theorem

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.900
How we can use that derivation of conditional probability?

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.200
to make an inference

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.400
about some

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.000
situation

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.400
this particular example comes from a very

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.300
great.

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.800
book that is not exactly a textbook but

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.700
It doesn't excellent job of explaining the intuition

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.900
 not just of bzean inference but statistics.

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.300
as a whole

14
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.000
and it's this book.

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.600
the art of statistics

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.700
learning from data

17
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.900
by David halter

18
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.200
and

19
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.200
just so you know.

20
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.200
the author is

21
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.100
well, it says here he served.

22
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.400
as the president of the royal statistical Society

23
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.300
and has been knighted for his services to statistics. So

24
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.300
you know, this is

25
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.700
a great expert on the topic of statistics

26
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.200
and that particular book describes the

27
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 intuition of Bayesian theorem

28
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.100
 very well in particular.

29
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.500
When it comes to the different terms that go into

30
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.700
 the formula namely odds.

31
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.300
and likelihood

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.500
Now, of course we are going to explore.

33
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.800
Bayesian theorem

34
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.200
when it comes to probability distributions, but

35
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.800
let this be our starting point.

36
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.800
Let's see how those terms in the Bayesian theorem.

37
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.300
are used

38
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.800
in a particular

39
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.500
example

40
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.900
so

41
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.400
this example has to do with

42
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.100
some case study or a thousand athletes

43
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.400
have to be tested.

44
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.400
for doping

45
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.200
Right. So in many professional sports

46
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.800
it is illegal for you to take certain.

47
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.400
drugs

48
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.300
or

49
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.500
the the practice of or when

50
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.800
 you take a illegal.

51
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.200
Drug substance to improve your

52
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.600
 performance or recovery. We call that doping.

53
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.300
So doping is illegal that many professional sports.

54
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.600
And athletes have to be randomly tested to make

55
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.400
 sure they don't have any.

56
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.700
illegal substances in their bloodstream

57
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.300
now the tests that is being performed is 95%

58
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.100
 accurate.

59
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.000
It is 95% accurate at.

60
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.300
You know.

61
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.700
Saying that someone is in fact doping.

62
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.300
and 95% accurate

63
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.600
to say that they are not doping.

64
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.000
And here we have a thousand athletes.

65
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.800
20 of those athletes are actually doping.

66
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.200
Now, let's say we we know this for a fact.

67
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.400
We know for a fact that they are doping.

68
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.900
And 980 are not.

69
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.000
So they're actually innocent.

70
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.300
So one more time.

71
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.000
We have a thousand athletes 20 of them are actually

72
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.700
 doping.

73
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.900
We know this.

74
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.700
Despite the test.

75
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.800
And 900 80 of them are not doping.

76
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.500
We know this for a fact.

77
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.500
Now we want to know.

78
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.100
If this screening test which has 95%

79
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.700
 accuracy.

80
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.000
could make

81
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.300
could tell us.

82
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.500
about this fact

83
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.300
that if we were to put

84
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.600
all of these 1,000 athletes through the test.

85
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.700
To what extent would it be correct? Yeah, it

86
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.000
 says 95% accurate but

87
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.700
there's actually more to it than what this.

88
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.600
That we then what we're told about the test.

89
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.000
So if it is 95% accurate how many?

90
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.500
How many athletes?

91
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.800
Who are doping cannot classify?

92
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.100
And in fact, that's the question here if the screening test

93
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.900
 is performed.

94
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.500
and the athlete tests positive

95
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.100
what is the probability that they are

96
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.200
 truly positive?

97
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.300
It could be the case that they

98
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.000
test positive incorrectly. That's what we call a false positive.

99
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.900
So how we are really asking is

100
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.500
How do we know if?

101
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.600
The result of the test is a true positive.

102
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.400
And here's a tree.

103
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.400
That can illustrate.

104
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.600
What we know about this particular problem.

105
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.100
So if you see here, we have 1,000 athletes.

106
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.500
And we set 20 of those 1,000 athletes

107
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.500
 are actually doping we know this for we know

108
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.100
 this for certain.

109
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.400
We know this with certainty.

110
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.600
And 980 are not doping. We

111
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.400
 also know this with certainty.

112
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.800
however, when we perform the screening test

113
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.700
the test manages to identify 19 out

114
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.200
 of those 20

115
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.800
athletes

116
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.400
19 out of those 20 doping athletes

117
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.900
one of them tested negative.

118
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.900
So that one person was actually.

119
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.700
Doping they were taking drugs, but the

120
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.200
 test failed to detect them.

121
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.200
In practice this can actually happen.

122
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.000
The sporting authorities do have a list

123
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200
 of illegal substances.

124
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.000
But there are ways you can chemically engineer.

125
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.000
the molecules

126
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.300
or the sequence of the drug somehow so that

127
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.200
 it evades the test. That's actually a problem,

128
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.000
 but it does happen.

129
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.700
So $20 doping 19 hour positive.

130
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.400
One of them is negative. So they're actually doping but

131
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.200
 they tested negative.

132
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.200
on the other side

133
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.200
We have 980 athletes who are not doping.

134
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.000
931

135
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.700
correctly tested negative

136
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.700
but 49

137
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.200
of those athletes

138
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.900
Tested positive.

139
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.300
with this information

140
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.600
We want to get an empirical.

141
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.200
quantity a numerical quantity

142
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.900
That tells us.

143
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.000
How this put how this this test would perform.

144
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.000
given two events where the first event

145
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.100
Is the actual test?

146
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.300
And the second event.

147
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.000
Is the doping.

148
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.000
condition of that athlete

149
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.800
to repeat the question. It says if the screening test is performed

150
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 and the athlete tests positive.

151
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.100
What is the probability that they are

152
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.600
 truly positive?

153
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.800
If I could rephrase this.

154
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.100
What is the probability that the athlete is guilty given?

155
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.600
The test is positive.

156
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.500
So we have the probability of a given B.

157
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.700
That's the particular question that we want to answer.

158
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.900
Now, how do we come about these numbers? Well, first

159
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.300
 of all, how do we get these numbers? Well, this

160
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.600
 is let's say we know this.

161
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.200
Maybe they are part of some sort

162
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.100
 of clinical study.

163
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.600
We have two.

164
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.600
groups one group we intentionally

165
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.600
Give them drugs the other 90 would

166
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.400
 the other 90 and 980 we don't.

167
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.600
And we do this for the purpose of seeing how effective our

168
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.400
 screening test is. So we know for a fact

169
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.700
 20 people are doping the others are not.

170
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.100
How do we acquire the other numbers?

171
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.300
well

172
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.300
This is how we do it, right?

173
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.800
We know that the test has a 95% accurate

174
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.400
 accuracy.

175
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.200
so if you multiply

176
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.400
the accuracy of the test

177
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.000
by the number of people who are actually doping we get

178
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.400
 19. So 19 is 95% of

179
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:54.800
 20.

180
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.000
And similarly 931 is

181
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.100
 95% of 980. That's

182
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.300
 basically we just multiply these two numbers by

183
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.400
 95 and then we get these numbers.

184
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.400
Then if we subtract 900 if we subtract

185
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.800
 980 from 931 we get 49.

186
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.100
And obviously subtract 20 from 19 we get

187
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.300
 one.

188
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.700
And that's how we get the numbers.

189
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.200
Now we know that the test is 95% accurate.

190
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.000
What we do not know.

191
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.600
So we know that it has 95.

192
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.300
It's probability is 0.95.

193
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.300
for testing positive or negative

194
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.700
But that is a modular probability.

195
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.500
We want to know what is the probability?

196
00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.900
That they test positive and they are actually guilty. So

197
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.800
 we have two events. We are measuring the probability of

198
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.400
 one event given another event.

199
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.600
It's not going to be 95%

200
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.400
and let's actually see how we can find out what the actual number is.
