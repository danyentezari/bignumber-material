00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.100
Here's another great.

1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.800
explanation of

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.800
the product of the prior and the

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.300
 likelihood

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.400
a visual demonstration

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.400
before I discussed this graph

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.500
 or this figure.

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.400
let me give you some background because this

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.100
figure is based on some analogy. And by the

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.900
 way this book.

10
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.500
I don't have the physical copy with me right now. It's in

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.800
 my office.

12
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.200
But this figure is from a very well written and

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.300
 popular book on Bayesian statistics called.

14
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.100
statistical rethinking

15
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.100
a Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.400
and this is specifically the second edition of this book.

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500
And the author of the book is Richard Mac. Alright, so the

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.000
 analogy the author gives us this suppose. You have

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.100
 one of these model Globes.

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.000
You know the ones you find on.

21
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.100
And offices where they put it put them on the

22
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.200
 desk.

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.700
and you want to use

24
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.800
the Bayesian intuition

25
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.900
for determining the proportion

26
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.900
Of land to Mass.

27
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.100
the planet Earth

28
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.000
and let's just say we know we are aliens. We

29
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700
 know nothing about the planet Earth.

30
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.000
We have no Factor figures.

31
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.000
And we want to figure this out.

32
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.500
What we do is you would we would pick up this.

33
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.200
globe

34
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.000
so you toss this little Global model into the air and then you catch it.

35
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.700
Okay.

36
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.000
You catch the globe.

37
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.300
And then you look at your index finger.

38
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.300
And see if under your finger you under in the index

39
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.600
 finger.

40
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.900
Whether you find water.

41
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.400
or land

42
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.000
and then you write that down.

43
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.700
So let's look at this example.

44
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.600
so

45
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.000
the top we're looking at how many?

46
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.700
Oh whether our outcome is a water or land.

47
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.100
and

48
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.800
down here on the x-axis

49
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.500
you're asking about the plausibility of seeing water.

50
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.700
Now the dashed line represents.

51
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.400
the prior

52
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.000
our our prior distribution

53
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.700
So before we toss the globe at all,

54
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.700
 it's still on the desk.

55
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.200
It's a flat.

56
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.700
Then we pick up the globe for the first time. We toss

57
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.700
 it in the air that we catch it.

58
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.100
We catch it and then when we look under our right index

59
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.700
 finger we find water.

60
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.300
So now the plausibility of seeing water goes up

61
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.600
 to one.

62
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.300
So the assumption is we know 100% of

63
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.700
 the land 100% of

64
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.000
 the Earth is water.

65
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.600
But then we pick up the globe toss it again.

66
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.000
Look again. Look under our index finger and this time

67
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.700
 you find land.

68
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.600
now the plausibility of seeing or the proportion

69
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 of

70
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.900
water to land is 50%

71
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.300
So one here represents.

72
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.900
Whether it's water or not.

73
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.200
And now it's gone down to 50% So it used to be 100% now.

74
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.500
 It's gone down to 50% water. So it's

75
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 50% 9 50% water.

76
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.500
this is

77
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.300
You know two.

78
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.900
experiments into the

79
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.800
you know this exercise.

80
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.600
We toss the globe once again and this time when we

81
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600
 look under our index finger we find water.

82
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.800
So now the

83
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.700
plausibility

84
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.300
or rather the proportion of water is skewed

85
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.400
 to the left, which me when we

86
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.300
 say skewed left. We mean we mean this tail over here, right?

87
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.100
So the peak here is at the right,

88
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.000
 but it's skewing to the left. So now it's more concentrated

89
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.200
 towards water. So we

90
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.600
 believe.

91
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.400
So far into our experiment.

92
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.000
That we have more water than we have land.

93
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.300
And that's the point right? So this was our prior distribution.

94
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.400
and after the new other experiment our

95
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.300
distribution has been changed. Oh, this

96
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.800
 is our posterior in other words. So this is our prior distribution. And

97
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.200
 now this is our posterior distribution. This is

98
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.500
 the this is the intuition of Bayesian.

99
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.300
inference

100
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.400
We make assumptions.

101
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.100
And then given new evidence we update.

102
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.500
our assumptions

103
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.500
and we continue this way we keep on tossing the globe

104
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.500
 costing the globe looking at whether it's water

105
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.300
 or land until we've eventually after non-experiments. We

106
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.600
 realize this is the proportion

107
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.000
 of land to water. So we have more water than

108
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.600
 we have land.

109
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.000
in practice

110
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.200
in a real world environment or in a real

111
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.900
 environment.

112
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.400
your priors

113
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.500
could come from

114
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.100
pre-existing

115
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.800
information

116
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.200
it could be expert data. It could be.

117
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.000
It could be data that existed before you begin

118
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.700
 your statistical statistical study.

119
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.900
But you have some idea you have some prior

120
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.400
 distribution.

121
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.400
And then as you gather new data.

122
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.400
which will

123
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.900
be evidence.

124
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.700
You will proceed to update your distributions.
