00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.500
Let's do this together.

1
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.000
so

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.200
this is for

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.500
example one

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.400
this is pmf.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.400
and CDF exercise

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.400
one

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.300
Okay.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.000
And how many questions do we have three?

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.600
This is question one.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.700
Is exercise one by the way?

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.600
You have two three questions question one question two.

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.400
and question three

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.300
so

14
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.400
here's how we figure out.

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.600
that P4

16
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.100
What is the probability?

17
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.500
for

18
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.400
the fourth or the value 4 in the random variable well

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.200
It calculate this.

20
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.600
You're asking.

21
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
Here's however, do it first of all add up.

22
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.100
the first

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.300
four probabilities so you would say

24
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.900
P0

25
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.900
zoom in a little bit so you can see more clearly.

26
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.500
So we have and then one.

27
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.300
and then two

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.100
and then three

29
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.300
and then four

30
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.100
Oh without four.

31
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.400
Let's do these first three if the add up.

32
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.700
You get 0.9.

33
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.600
If you add these up numbers, so this point 30

34
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.200
 plus 0.25. That's 55.

35
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.500
And then 75 and the plus Point 15, it's

36
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.000
 90.

37
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.600
So the first four add up to

38
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.900
point 90

39
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.000
if they all add up to point 90

40
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.500
and we know for a fact that the probability stops at

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.600
 one.

42
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.200
What could the probability of four possibly be?

43
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.600
I mean the first four have taken up.

44
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.000
0.90 of the probability number

45
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.200
what is left?

46
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.300
The answer is point 10.

47
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.600
right

48
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.000
Add these two numbers together and you get one.

49
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.000
this

50
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500
exercise is to stress that probability cannot go past

51
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.800
 one.

52
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.000
question number two

53
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.500
What is the probability that at least two patients visit the clinic during office

54
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.700
 hours?

55
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.600
So the answer is the probability for two is point

56
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.500
 two and then point three.

57
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.500
And then point four we already found that right point four. We know it's it's

58
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.800
 point 10.

59
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.700
So Point 20 plus 0.50 plus point 10.

60
00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.800
so

61
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.200
Point 20 or let me write it down this way you have to probably have

62
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.600
 two plus the probability of three plus the probability

63
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.000
 of 4.

64
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.700
For probability of two we have Point 20.

65
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.200
For probably a three what was it 15?

66
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.400
and for four we had

67
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.900
point 10

68
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.300
Okay. So question you want to give us the probability for?

69
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.600
when four patients show up to the clinic

70
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.700
that was point 10.

71
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.800
And then we use that to our advantage.

72
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.000
because the first

73
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.100
for for two patients and three patients that probably was

74
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.100
 given we take the one from for four patients add them

75
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.700
 all together and we get the answer which is four point.

76
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.300
0.45

77
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.000
0.45

78
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.800
What is the third question?

79
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.300
What is the problem this is very similar. What is a probability that more

80
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.300
 than two patients visit the clinic during office hours.

81
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.300
More than two patients same like let

82
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.400
 me give you this the same.

83
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.100
Like you're looking at the answer more than two patients.

84
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.000
more than two patients

85
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.800
I'll leave this out here.

86
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.900
so you can

87
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.200
more easily solve the problem.

88
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.900
I'll give you more. I'll give you more hint.

89
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.800
so here

90
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.400
The question is asking. What is it probability?

91
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.800
That more than two patients.

92
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.700
So that's X.

93
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.500
Well more than two patients. That's three or greater.

94
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.700
right

95
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.100
In other words, what is the probability that X will take on

96
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.400
 3?

97
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.000
or

98
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.000
or X will take on 4.

99
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.400
We can't go past four. I mean that's that's that's the maximum

100
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.100
 number of patients that are allowed inside the clinic.

101
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.100
I encourage even those who are not answering questions to at least think about

102
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.300
 it.

103
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.900
Matthew Anders, David who wants to answer this question

104
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.000
Should I continue the answer? I'm going to go ahead and type in top at the

105
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.100
 answer.

106
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.300
Yeah, but don't put your share and don't share your answer

107
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.600
 in the channel for everyone to see.

108
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.800
but yeah, that's the

109
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.000
that's the correct answer.

110
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.800
Okay.

111
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.600
So the answer is you know.

112
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.200
You just have to accumulate add

113
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.000
 up the numbers out of the probability.

114
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.900
For when you have three patients or patients?

115
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.200
So essentially we have P of

116
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.300
 3.

117
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.400
Plus

118
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.100
4

119
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.200
then adds up to 0.25.

120
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.400
if you take

121
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.000
A 0.3. Excuse me the probability for

122
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.900
X at 3 it's 0.15.

123
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.200
And probably of X being at

124
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.800
 and probably have X at 4. Well, we already talked about it's point

125
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.600
 point one. So point three plus.

126
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.000
point 10 that gives us Point 25
