00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.200
Okay, everybody. We don't have 10 pennies at 10 minutes past.

1
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.100
the hour

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.700
I was hoping to show you an example with.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.400
Show you RC examples with the exercises

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.000
 what we have.

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.500
But you know sometimes technical failures are

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.300
 on avoidable now the less.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.200
I think you know some of us shared our

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.900
 interest in having.

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.800
a workshops

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.300
dedicated exclusively to

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 our studio and our programming.

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.400
And I think we will definitely have one.

13
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.500
I mean that was a plan. Anyway, we would do three work.

14
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.800
 We would have three sessions.

15
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.500
in this series and then

16
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.300
going forward with that we would have had workshops dedicated to

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 certain to like specific topics in our

18
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 study would be among them.

19
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.700
But I will definitely up like share the

20
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.200
 scripts with you.

21
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.100
with documentation

22
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.300
and then we will revisit that we will definitely

23
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.500
 by the way revisit these scripts for day

24
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.800
 three because

25
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.200
on day through like I said, we will continue talking

26
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.600
 about

27
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.700
Random variables and probably distributions. We

28
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.500
 will then talk about new topics like Point estimation.

29
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.400
or estimation in general and we'll

30
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 talk about

31
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.000
estimating points estimating confidence intervals, which

32
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.100
 will be important because

33
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.700
we are going to

34
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.100
Work our way towards hypothesis testing and regression analysis two

35
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 ways two important ways.

36
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.100
for

37
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.400
conducting a statistical study. So everything we covered.

38
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.000
Day one day two.

39
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.600
Will be Revisited on day three.

40
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400
culminating in a comprehensive

41
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.200
Statistical study so we will do our studio.

42
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.100
 We will do more examples more exercises.

43
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.600
and

44
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.600
hopefully

45
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.700
we will be.

46
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.500
Probably like we will be able to complete all

47
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.800
 of that in a better place.

48
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.500
But I will I will share the details for day

49
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.700
 three and the preparations would

50
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.700
 have to make for that day on Slack.

51
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.400
So if you're not on slack yet, please go ahead and join us

52
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.100
 join snack so you don't miss out on that.
