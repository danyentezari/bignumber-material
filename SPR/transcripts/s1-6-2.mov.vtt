00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.800
so I'm going to come back to box map this prototype

1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.400
 app to

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.800
See how we can answer this question. So

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.900
the first one

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.600
we're not getting into.

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.100
the basics of probability

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.400
and this is

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.000
example 1

8
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.600
okay.

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.300
How many questions we have? We have one two, three. So for number one.

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.800
answer one

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.900
the easy Reason by the way develop this app is because

12
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.500
we can I can type mathematically without

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.600
 any scribbling.

14
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.500
so

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.400
here's how you

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.500
type in this this is how you set notation.

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.100
I want you to focus here. Okay, I'm gonna write the code for here, but I

18
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.300
 want you to pay attention here.

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.400
They ask for a set s so s equals.

20
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.800
 Okay, that's

21
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.300
containing

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.700
all of the outcomes

23
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.000
of

24
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.800
the

25
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.300
experiments of rolling your dice. Let me start with a simple

26
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.600
 example.

27
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.800
if you were flipping a coin

28
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.300
once if you had one experiment then your

29
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.300
 sample space would look like this.

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.300
This is this is set notation.

31
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.400
Okay, this is your set.

32
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.300
the collection and the curly bracket

33
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.200
means that you know, this is what you have.

34
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.800
You have a heads.

35
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.700
and the tail

36
00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.900
Okay.

37
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.500
Now I'm going to save us time.

38
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.300
and

39
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.100
show you the entire sample set because there are

40
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.800
 36 of them and I don't want to type them all one by one.

41
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.200
So the answer to that question.

42
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.200
is the following

43
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.800
and I want you to see tell me if we can understand the notation

44
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.900
 What's Happening Here?

45
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.000
So we have one one we have one two.

46
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.700
We have one three. What does this mean?

47
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.900
the first one

48
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.800
this is not 11. This is one one.

49
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.300
You roll a dice?

50
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.700
And your outcome is you get one one.

51
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.600
in each dice

52
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.500
you roll the die again. You get one in one

53
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500
 dice to get two on the other dice.

54
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.200
All the way up to where you have six.

55
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800
On this thighs and that dies.

56
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.400
so this

57
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.500
Is set notation by the way if you haven't seen it before.

58
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.300
Basically, this is how mathematically Express the

59
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.600
 situation.

60
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.900
So here we have six in each dice. That's

61
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.100
this one over here six and six

62
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.500
Okay, a family rise of stuff with this because we will do an exercise involving

63
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.800
 this type of notation.

64
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.100
Then it says

65
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.000
you set notation.

66
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.500
to less the event e

67
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.900
where the die is rolled and the outcomes at outcomes add

68
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.300
 up to six.

69
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.000
Now I want you to think about this.

70
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.000
Look at this set.

71
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.000
how many of these add up to six so one and plus one

72
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.400
 is two

73
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.400
That's not it. So the set will not let me actually write the

74
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.700
the outer part

75
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.200
and help you guess what should go in here next?

76
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.300
Okay, so what should go here?

77
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.600
So whatever goes in here you just keep in mind that the numbers.

78
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.500
Must add up to six for example. Well, I

79
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.800
 don't want to give you an example. This is what I want to jump to.

80
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.800
Slack

81
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.900
and show you how we will proceed with exercises.

82
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.400
So on slack, there's a channel.

83
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.300
called statistics probability Theory and r

84
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.000
I want everyone to join.

85
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.700
Here's the link again.

86
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.200
And I want you to send me the answer.

87
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.700
Send me the answer to this small exercise.

88
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.900
And you can choose to type in the answer you can choose into.

89
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.400
Maybe right on a piece of paper and send me the picture.

90
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.700
or

91
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.000
you know, however you want to send it, but send it to me

92
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.000
 privately so I can

93
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.300
track your progress. We'll do this would spend five minutes

94
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.800
 on this no more and then I'll show you the answer.

95
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.300
Just want to get your family with a set notation.

96
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.000
Who's working on the exercise if you're working on the exercise type and working?

97
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.700
I want to see how many of you are actually participating by the way mathematics is

98
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.700
 not a spectator sport.

99
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.400
You do not want to be a spectator if you don't.

100
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.200
the way your brain works when you're learning is if

101
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.900
 you don't like

102
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.300
do the work.

103
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.200
Like the way you the wiring of your brain?

104
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.900
Has been his design.

105
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.000
If you don't like physically.

106
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.800
Do the work.

107
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.500
It won't be as effective. Elena says I am listening but cannot

108
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.400
 currently participate that's okay, but hopefully maybe by the

109
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.500
 way this session is being recorded. So once maybe in your

110
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.200
 free time, you can rewatch this video and do the exercise

111
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.200
 but I strongly recommend that you try we will only

112
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.000
 spend five minutes on it.

113
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.200
But let get your Mighty think about how

114
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.000
 you should go about it. Just keep in mind that the points

115
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.000
 must add up to six.

116
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.600
So for example, you wouldn't put one one one.

117
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.600
It's as up to two.

118
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.200
To try that again and no cheating. Don't try

119
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.300
 to go don't Google this. Okay. This is not an exam. This is only

120
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.300
 to put your mind in a state that you were you.

121
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.700
You know.

122
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.900
That encourages you and motivates you to.

123
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.300
Look for this solution.

124
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.600
excellent

125
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.800
By the way people if necessary.

126
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.900
We can add more days to the workshop. My goal here is to

127
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.600
help you learn not.

128
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.200
cram, and

129
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.400
make you anxious

130
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.500
excellent

131
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.200
Okay.

132
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.200
Let's go ahead and solve this problem together.

133
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.600
And I want you to help you do this. Okay?

134
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.800
So I'm gonna come down here which numbers

135
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.800
 add up to six like which points we

136
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.300
 have one. One two, one three one plus one is two that's

137
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.700
 not it.

138
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.100
OnePlus 3

139
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.300
That's 4 that's not it. How about one

140
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.200
 and five that adds up

141
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.200
 to six? So let's put that in there one and five.

142
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.500
one and five

143
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:38.700
Okay.

144
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.100
Which one which one? Can we put

145
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.300
 in here? Not this one? Not this one. How about

146
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.100
Two plus four two and four. I'm gonna put one for in there.

147
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.800
What about

148
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.400
let's see.

149
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.100
33 thank you Casey 33. That's another one

150
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.500
 three plus three adds up to six.

151
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.500
And then we have four 42. That's 4 plus

152
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:04.600
 2.

153
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.200
4 and 2

154
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.100
and then we have what else do

155
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.200
 we have?

156
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.700
Five and one, right?

157
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.200
Thank you. Okay, see five and one.

158
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.200
And then what else do we have?

159
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:17.900
I think that's it.

160
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.000
I hope I haven't missed any.

161
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.600
so we have

162
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.300
one two three, four five

163
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.200
So that's our event space.

164
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.100
This is a subset of that.

165
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.300
You're learning two things by the way, you're learning both set theory and

166
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.200
 probabilities here. Now. This is a subset of that. What does that mean? What does

167
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.300
 it mean for for something to be a subset of something else? It means

168
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.500
 that this

169
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.100
Set contains some of the elements of this

170
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.800
 set.

171
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200
Okay, not vice versa.

172
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.400
Okay, this set has all of the elements of

173
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.100
 this set, but this set has a subset of the

174
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.700
 elements of this set, but that's it.

175
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.600
So that's it for question 2.

176
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.300
Then we have question 3. What is the probability of event e in

177
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.100
 the sample space this is

178
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.700
I'm going to give you hint.

179
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.500
I'm Gonna Give You hint.

180
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.800
I'll go back to.

181
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.200
this slide

182
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.800
if you have six sides on a dice.

183
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.000
What is it? Probably that you would get a 3?

184
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.100
if you roll the dice once one out of six

185
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.400
Each face on the dice gets one.

186
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:43.700
You know.

187
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:44.800
like

188
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.300
I don't want to use any word by mistake but

189
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.800
 like the chances one out of six.

190
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.300
no dice gets

191
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.200
has some magical power like you

192
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.200
 I know some people they take a dough Dice and they blow into

193
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.100
 their fist or

194
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.100
They do some magical movement.

195
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.300
Hoping that if they roll the dice, they'll get lucky and the stars are lying

196
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.900
 and get a sex. It's not gonna work that way.

197
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.900
You get one out of six?

198
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.500
Unless you know if unless, you know something about weight

199
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.900
 distribution and physics like those expert Casino

200
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.200
 players, but blowing into your face

201
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.100
 not gonna change it's gonna be one over six. So now that you

202
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.400
 know, this is it gonna help you figure out this question for answer number

203
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:31.500
 three.

204
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.800
It's a simple fraction.

205
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.100
What is the size of 5? Excuse me? What are the size of e how many

206
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.400
 elements do we have in five? One, two, three, four five?

207
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.600
Very funny Alex, or maybe you could be lucky but for for

208
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.900
 the for most people the probability

209
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.100
 will will not change for them.

210
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.500
Okay, how many items do we have in the set e five?

211
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.400
 How many items do you have in this sets? S36?

212
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.500
 Well, there's your answer the answer.

213
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.200
Two question three. What is the probability?

214
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.200
of these numbers appearing

215
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.000
out of these numbers is

216
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:20.900
five

217
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.200
out of 36

218
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.100
Okay, 5 over 36 which adds up

219
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.300
 to?

220
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.200
This number now this number is important. I'll tell you

221
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.300
 why.

222
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.100
Remember that probability is a number between 0 and

223
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.400
 1.

224
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.200
You can think about one big 100 percent and if we turn

225
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.200
 this into percentage, it will be 30% It's the probability that these

226
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.900
 numbers will come.

227
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.700
you will get these numbers out of

228
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.800
all the other possibilities is

229
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.700
13.30 or 13 percent almost 14%

230
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.500
 if you round up.

231
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.800
then notation for probability is this

232
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.300
p

233
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:13.800
What is my?

234
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.100
the probability of E

235
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800
That's what this is. No this notation.

236
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.400
P has to be uppercase

237
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.800
P has to be application if you want to if you want to express this

238
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.400
 idea the probability of e happening.

239
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.000
given this

240
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.400
Given, this is the sample sample size is 0.13.

241
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.600
So for example if you are betting on a number on a

242
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:43.700
 dice.

243
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.200
You want to bet on you? Should you should you should you can

244
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.600
 put this to your advantage like you can sit down and write them down and see which

245
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.000
 subset.

246
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.900
What event is a subset of this apple said what subset

247
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.600
 of the sample space will have more elements?

248
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.700
If it has more elements elements, I said elephants the

249
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.600
 more elements. There are in the subset the higher

250
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:09.900
 the probability.

251
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.300
And guess what people who work in casinos know

252
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.600
 this and use it to their advantage.

253
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.500
Okay. Now this is just the basic.

254
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.600
example

255
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.300
But even knowing the basics will get you

256
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:28.400
 far.
