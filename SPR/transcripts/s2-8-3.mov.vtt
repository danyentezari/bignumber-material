00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.500
Now before I move on let me show you.

1
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.400
the function 5

2
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.300
Which is right here, and then I'm going to show you how it works.

3
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.500
With Wolfram. Well, you can

4
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.600
 use any calculator, but we will use a quote from alpha for this.

5
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.200
so we want

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.000
the

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.200
cumulative distribution function

8
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
of they standardized normal variable of the

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.900
 normal distribution rather know what distribution

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.200
let me make sure we have the correct formula.

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.800
So there's two things we want to look at. This is number one.

12
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.500
one

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.400
and two

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.200
this

15
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.500
is

16
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.900
the formula for the normal distribution

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.500
and then there was one.

18
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.100
for the standardized

19
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.100
normal distribution

20
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.600
the normal distribution without it being standardized as this formula.

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.600
Okay, we will break down these terms.

22
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.800
So we know why I mean what it means, okay.

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.100
But when you standardize it.

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.200
you will get

25
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.100
okay.

26
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.200
Now when you use r

27
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.600
these

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.400
like the function is built into the language.

29
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.700
 You don't actually have to

30
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.800
type out the expression and plug them in.

31
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.400
It's built in but you still need to know how they work.

32
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.400
and

33
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600
what when you should use which one?
