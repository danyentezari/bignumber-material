while we are trying to understand

1
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.300
we want to know as much as we can about the population.

2
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.800
the most important

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.700
characteristic

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.500
about

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.700
population about a population about its

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.900
 sample

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.800
is its average?

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.300
We might not be able to know everything we want to know

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.400
 about.

10
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.400
A population of population of people a population

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.700
 of elephants a population of smartphones you name it a

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.400
 population doesn't have to do with people it can be living things.

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.100
 It can be, you know products.

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.300
That are sold in a store.

15
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.200
Okay, but it has to do with with entirety.

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.200
We can't know everything there is to know we can't know every

17
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.100
 single detail about.

18
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.400
population

19
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.100
but

20
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.000
we can know a great deal about its average.

21
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.100
If you look at people we want to know the average height of

22
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.300
 people the average weight of people average income

23
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.700
 of people.

24
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.000
the average concentration

25
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.300
of people in an urban area

26
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.800
Okay, they were always be allies but the averages will

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.700
 be more helpful to us. Of course. The outliers

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.100
 are important.

29
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.000
But the average is you know, what?

30
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.300
What we're more concerned about let's say

31
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.700
 you are a marketing or let's say you're a retail company.

32
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.200
And you sell?

33
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.200
luxury bags

34
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.900
He said luxury bags and your target audience.

35
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.100
Are people who have more disposable income?

36
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.200
and you have to decide where to

37
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.200
advertise

38
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.400
Let's see you you have a you want

39
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.200
 to advertise that people in the shopping mall? Okay, let's forget about

40
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.600
 digital marketing for a second.

41
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.500
Forget about online ads and videos and Instagram

42
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.100
 and all of that.

43
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.400
You want to place a ad in the shopping mall that

44
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.500
 says?

45
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.800
A new bags for the season by the

46
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.500
 great white one of the best designers ever.

47
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.100
Where in that shopping mall, would you place that at?

48
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.300
Okay, you can't obviously plaster on that everywhere. That's not

49
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.300
 going to work. You need to be selected with where you put that advertisement.

50
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.400
You need to figure out for example, this is where the the

51
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.700
 idea of averages will come on average. Most people with

52
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.100
 more with the high disposable income where they spend their time.

53
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.100
Do they spend their time at the dollar store?

54
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200
Are they it you know in the

55
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.400
 food court where there is.

56
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.300
Fast food probably not they probably spend there.

57
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.900
time

58
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.700
at some restaurant where you know

59
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.400
like a three Michelin three star three Michelin

60
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.300
 star restaurant, you know fine dining or there's

61
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.900
On the second floor for example or the fifth for whatever where they

62
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.700
 sell jewelry and watches.

63
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.500
so, you know, okay the bulk of my

64
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.400
I'm not saying people who have high disposable then come don't go don't have

65
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.700
 McDonald's but the majority of them if they're in the shopping mall, let's

66
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.200
 say they would spend their time. Let's see

67
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.000
 in the upper levels.

68
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.600
where the

69
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.800
luxury brands are

70
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.800
You know.

71
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.700
They exist.

72
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.000
So she okay. It will be best if we would have the most.

73
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.400
Attraction most traction if we put our ads in

74
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.300
 that part of the shopping mall because the majority

75
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.800
 the majority of the average of our

76
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.100
 demographic our Target demographic is in

77
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.600
 that part.

78
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.500
Now that's just one example.

79
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.000
of how

80
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.000
knowing about the average or understanding average is going to

81
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.300
Help you make better decisions. This is true. Whether

82
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.300
 you're right whether you're in Commerce in you

83
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.000
 know in healthcare.

84
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.900
Manufacturing and Space Engineering.

85
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.600
 You name it?

86
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.200
statistics and probability Theory

87
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.700
are important in all areas.

88
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.600
But what you see here are three key terms?

89
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.000
three things that describe

90
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.500
this

91
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.700
the idea of the average in statistics and probability now, we

92
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.400
 will come we will I will talk about these if you don't know what these three

93
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.700
 means. I will Define it for you.

94
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.900
But perhaps the most important.

95
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.700
of these three

96
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.900
is the mean

97
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.100
Okay, in fact so important it is.

98
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.700
It's so important.

99
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.300
that there was a special kind of

100
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.100
mean
