00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.100
Look at this picture.

1
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.000
And let's look at the probability first.

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.000
We said that the definition of probability.

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.300
is

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.800
The Chosen number of outcomes plus the

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.900
 total number of possible outcomes

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.000
suppose you have

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.700
marbles

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.500
Four of them are blue.

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.100
six of them are yellow

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.200
What is the probability of getting a Blue Marble?

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.000
You put your hand into a jar. What is a probability that if

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 you put your hand into this jar of mixed of

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 marbles with mixed colors, what is it? Probably

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.900
 of it turning blue?

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.100
That will be four.

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.400
over 10

17
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.300
right

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
same thing with the coins or something with a coin.

19
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.900
if you flip a coin

20
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.500
Which I which obviously has two faces. What is

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.100
 there? Probably that you would get a particular face.

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.700
1 over 2 you have two possible outcomes.

23
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.900
And your chosen outcome is one.

24
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.200
So what we do is we compare.

25
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.200
The Chosen number of outcomes over the total possible number total possible

26
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.900
 number of outcomes

27
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.300
now odds

28
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.300
is the ratio

29
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.900
of

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.300
one

31
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.400
chose set of chosen outcomes versus another set

32
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.200
 of chosen outcomes.

33
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.600
Or set differently it is it is

34
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.300
 the ratio of one event.

35
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.100
over another event

36
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.600
and basically if the odds if we

37
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.000
 evaluate this quantity.

38
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200
and the number is greater than 1

39
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.900
then the odds are in favor of the event in the numerator.

40
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.300
If the number Falls below one, then the odds are in favor of

41
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.100
 the event in the denominator.

42
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.400
And obviously if odds is equal to 1 that means

43
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.200
 both of them are.

44
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.000
They have this their equivalent.

45
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.100
So we have a one-to-one ratio.

46
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.000
Both of them have equal probability. So 50%

47
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.600
50% this 50% down.

48
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.500
If you look at this picture.

49
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.500
Obviously if you were to evaluate this if we would have

50
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.700
 four divided by 6.

51
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.100
This quantity would be below 1.

52
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.800
So the odds would be in favor of the denominator.

53
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.400
Obviously right when we if we have more golden marbles than

54
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.400
 if you were to put your hand into the jar, you're more likely

55
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.700
 or the probability is greater that you would get a

56
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.100
 golden a gold model versus a Blue Marble.

57
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.400
So odds one event over

58
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.100
 another event.

59
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.000
Now likelihood is an extension of odds.

60
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.400
The difference is likelihood is the ratio of

61
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.100
 two conditional probabilities.

62
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.500
a given B

63
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.500
over for example a given C

64
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.700
same idea

65
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.500
Okay.

66
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.600
Now, let's go back to the other document.
