00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.400
So we want to work with a data set when I

1
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.400
 say that is I'm gonna like an Excel sheet. We have rows and

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.900
 columns and you want to calculate something one

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.700
 that is built into our studio. It's called

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.400
 empty cars and to bring it into the file you

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.800
 reference it like so you don't have to actually download anywhere.

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.600
So you when you do when you do when you run this line of

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.600
 code, you can do this with me you are going to bring in

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.800
 this sample data set into your file.

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.200
now if you want to get a sample of what is

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.500
 contained in this data structure in this

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.100
File there's a function called Head.

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.400
Which will show you the first?

13
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.400
you know couple of

14
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.000
Rows. So for example, this data set has to

15
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 do with cards and their specifications. So for

16
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 example,

17
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.900
like if you want to see the entire data set.

18
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.000
You can click on it and this is the whole.

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.200
Data collection for this for this for this for this

20
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.700
 car. So we have

21
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.300
the leftmost column of course are some car

22
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.700
 models.

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.600
Okay, and then they're corresponding specifications.

24
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.900
Number of cylinders they have their horsepower their

25
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 weight.

26
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.400
And you can use this for example to determine their standard deviation

27
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 their variance the four moments. So for

28
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.100
 example

29
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.900
If you want to read a particular column.

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.900
in this

31
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.100
data, you would say maybe empty cars then you would

32
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.900
 put in the dollar sign.

33
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.300
And then when you put in the dollar sign, you can

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.000
 then choose that particular.

35
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.600
A column column of data. So for example MPG

36
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.300
Okay, and this will tell you these are all of the values.

37
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.300
Contained that column.

38
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.200
Now, for example, we can also do you do something like summary?

39
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
You can either do summary for the whole data set.

40
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.800
or a summary for

41
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.300
a particular column

42
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.400
Okay, of course, you have to make sure to select that line or put your

43
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.300
 curse at that line run the code.

44
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.300
And then you would get some information some brief. Now. You can

45
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.300
 actually expand on the summary, but this is some.

46
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.300
This is an some glimpse into your data. So for

47
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.800
 the mpg column.

48
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.100
Min means the smallest value

49
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.300
is 10

50
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.200
The biggest of them all is 33.9.

51
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.600
the first quartile

52
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.800
the number corresponding to the first quartile

53
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.700
 is 15.43.

54
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.900
The median is 19.20 and so on.
