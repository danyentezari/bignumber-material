00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.800
Now there is a rule.

1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.000
the 6895

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.500
99.7 rule

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.100
Yeah, I'll show you a picture of it from Wikipedia.

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.700
and it says this

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.100
okay.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.600
If you have a normal distribution.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.900
If you have a normal distribution.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.200
if

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.000
the experiment that you're looking at or the sample space

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.100
 containing the experiment.

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
Is within one standard deviation of the mean.

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.400
This is assuming that the experiments have

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
 a normal distribution to begin with.

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.700
Okay, if they have a normal distribution if they're

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.600
 within one standard deviation away from the mean there's a

16
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.100
 68%

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.200
probability that there was experiments will take place.

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.900
two standard deviations away

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000
from the mean 95%

20
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.500
probability that they will

21
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.400
You know occur.

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.000
and of course if we go three standard deviations away

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.500
 from the mean

24
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.200
99.7

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400
% probability that they will take place.

26
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.800
If you go past three standard deviation, that's Overkill now I'm talking

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.000
 about this because when we get into the

28
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.500
 topic of estimation

29
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.000
Which leads us to?

30
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.500
Ultimately two topics, we will finish our series with

31
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 two topics hypothesis, testing and

32
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.500
 regression analysis.

33
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.300
Everything we are learning.

34
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.600
Is going to lead it's going to lead to that point where we

35
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.000
 will look at one.

36
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.600
Comprehensive statistical study what we do one hypothesis test.

37
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.000
And a regression analysis with r and visualization

38
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 will have different we will

39
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.600
 have different graphs to look at like histograms Scatter

40
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.200
 Plots with fitting ball plots,

41
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.500
 all that good stuff. Okay, and knowing this information knowing

42
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.200
 this rule about the normal distribution is is very

43
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.400
Okay, and that's what this text is talking about

44
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.600
 here.

45
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.300
as you go

46
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.400
as you take the problem the CDF.

47
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.900
of standard deviations and you step away from the mean the probability

48
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.400
 will increase okay because you you are

49
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.900
Well, I mean it's in the name you're accumulating more probability.

50
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.000
across the experiments

51
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.100
This is just rephrasing what we

52
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.500
 talked about earlier. Now the results of this example

53
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.700
 are often reporting percentage for of course, you

54
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.100
 can't do that.

55
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.200
the number of probabilities between of course

56
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.000
 you are one, but if you want percentage, you can

57
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.600
 just multiply it and you can

58
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.200
use percentage
