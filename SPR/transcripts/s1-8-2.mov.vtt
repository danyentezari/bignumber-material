00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.400
now before I move on

1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.400
why is the random variable and the probability distribution together?

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.200
Expressed in the form of table. Well, then they're not only expressed in the formal

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.200
 table. They're expressed also, or they are

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.300
 visualized in the form of a bar chart.

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.900
and scatterplot

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.100
And box and whisker plot, I'm sure you've seen

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.700
 these graphs.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
All over the place, they all

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.700
 different kinds of graphs.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.100
and plot plots

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.300
and you always thought you'd probably tell yourself. What do these?

12
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.800
graphs really mean

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.900
to generate

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.200
histograms, too. Yes histograms, too.

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.200
All of these for all of these, you know in order for to be

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.700
 to in excuse me in order for it to be able to visualize.

17
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.300
statistics

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.100
you first need to produce.

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.300
a random variable

20
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.600
with its corresponding probably distribution

21
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.900
And that can be a table, which is quite basic or you can if now

22
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.500
 when does visualization come in handy is when you have a huge

23
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.000
 data set.

24
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.900
Here, maybe we don't need that. We don't need a graph here like we

25
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.000
 can.

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.600
See it in our heads what that graph would look like but once you have a big numbers, we

27
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.300
 have a huge data set if a big sample space.

28
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.800
Okay, and you have many events with different

29
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.100
 outcomes.

30
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.400
That's when visualization comes into play.

31
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.400
That's when seeing a trend in upward Trend or a

32
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.800
 downward trend.

33
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.700
becomes obvious

34
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.900
But first, of course, you need to understand the mathematical notation.

35
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.000
Okay.

36
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.600
now

37
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.500
the probably distribution describes the probability of the values

38
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.600
 within a random variable.

39
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.600
Similar to the probability Mass function is something called

40
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.200
 the cumulative distribution function.

41
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.300
now listen carefully

42
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.900
there are three kinds of probability distribution

43
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.400
 functions.

44
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.900
Let me type them in here.

45
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.100
three kinds of probability

46
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.600
distribution functions

47
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.400
I'll probably distribution that would lower describes

48
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.600
 the probability of values and random variable the probability

49
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.300
 distribution function.

50
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.800
or functions

51
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.600
the first one

52
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.700
Is the probability Mass function?

53
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.100
Also known just by probably distribution. So these two things are

54
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.700
 identical keep this in mind.

55
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.600
distribution

56
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.000
distribution

57
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.700
the second one

58
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800
is called probability.

59
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600
density function

60
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.400
PDF

61
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.500
this is related to continuous random

62
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.700
 variables.

63
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.200
Remember the number numeric system I told you about we had whole numbers

64
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.800
 integers.

65
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.800
And then real numbers.

66
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.600
When we get into real numbers when we get into continuous numbers.

67
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.800
That's when we talk about probability density function. Why are

68
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.500
 we not doing it today? Because

69
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.700
in order for you to understand probably density function.

70
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.400
Or working with continuous numbers or continuous quantities

71
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.300
 and statistics probability. You need to know

72
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.600
 calculus at least single variable calculus.

73
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.100
Integration differentiation, but let's leave that for later.

74
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.600
We won't cover this here. The third one is

75
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.900
 called the cumulative.

76
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.500
distribution

77
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.200
function and this

78
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.100
is used both for continuous and discrete

79
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.500
 numbers.

80
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.400
Okay.

81
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.200
Both for discrete random variables and continuous random

82
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.300
 variables. So remember there are two types

83
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.200
 of random variables.

84
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.900
two types

85
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.700
one is discrete.

86
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.900
Discrete, that's one type.

87
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.000
and one is

88
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.400
continuous

89
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.700
That's also another type.

90
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.400
In this session, we are concerned with this type.

91
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.500
because we don't have to deal with Calculus and

92
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.200
similar

93
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.000
Calculus series and sequences. So two

94
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.600
 types of discrete. Yeah and also for

95
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.900
 a probability distribution

96
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
There will be discrete public distribution continuous public distribution, but there are

97
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.800
 three kinds of functions that generate these probabilities probability

98
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.700
 distributions. Pmf PDF CDF.

99
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.700
So we've looked at this one now. Let's look at this one.

100
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.300
Okay, we're here now.
