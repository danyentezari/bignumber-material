00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.300
Let's begin with some basic.

1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.400
Set theory.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.200
because again

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.600
the Bayesian theorem depends on conditional probability

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.900
 and conditional probability.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.000
has to do with

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.700
sets

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.900
the combination of sets

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.000
so let's look at an example. I'm going to

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.900
 draw two.

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.500
Venn diagrams

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.900
and in both sets we have elements.

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.300
some of these some of these elements

13
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.500
could be common to both of these sets.

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.400
So for example

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.900
Okay.

16
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000
Let me grab a screenshot and bring it into markdown.

17
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.200
Okay, so we have these two sets A and B if we were to.

18
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.400
Take the intersection of these two sets we

19
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.900
 would get something that looks like this. Of course.

20
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.300
So the elements that are common to both sets are

21
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.600
 the elements.

22
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.400
D and E

23
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.400
And as usual, if we were to take the union of

24
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 these two sets. Well, then we'll get all the elements.

25
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.700
Okay, so the above it?

26
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.400
is intersection

27
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.700
the one that is below is the Union.

28
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
So here we are saying it has to be the elements

29
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.800
 that we are looking for must be inside set a

30
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.900
 and in set B.

31
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.300
And as you can see, we only have d and e that

32
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.900
 is common to both.

33
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.600
in the second example we were saying

34
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.800
Elements that are coming to either one.

35
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.200
and of course

36
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.500
we get all the elements.

37
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.100
We get all the distinct elements.

38
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.400
from a to H

39
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.200
Now let's talk about now. Let's look at an example where instead of

40
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.400
 we

41
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.000
having

42
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.100
non-numeric elements in the sets A and

43
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.200
 B. Let's look at an example where we have quantities in these

44
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.500
 sets.

45
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.900
Then we could produce a table.

46
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.000
where we have

47
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.700
something called the marginals

48
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.500
so we will need to see that we'll have the table containing

49
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.200
 the marginals.

50
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.000
And then we'll see how we can translate that table into the

51
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.700
 conditional probability. So

52
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.500
 we first will go from the table of data.

53
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.600
Two conditional probability once we get an understanding

54
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.100
 of what symbols mean

55
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.600
 and why certain axioms hold we will

56
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.700
 then proceed to derive the basic theorem.

57
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.500
So I'm going to once again.

58
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.700
Reproduce this Venn diagram a little bit differently.

59
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.800
two sets

60
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.100
and this could be sets containing a number of elements.

61
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.400
For example some products and it could be the case that these

62
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.000
 two sets have a number of things in common.

63
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.500
If we were taking if we were to take it into

64
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.500
 section of these two sets.

65
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.300
and let's say

66
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.500
they have five things in common.

67
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.700
So set a has 65 things set B

68
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.000
 has 10.

69
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.800
Common to both of them are five particular

70
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.500
 things. So imagine you have two stores. They have

71
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.800
 five.

72
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.000
Similar products they both have these five products.

73
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.800
Or this could be a two sets of people.

74
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.900
And these two sets have five people in common.

75
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.600
Let's say set B is a

76
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.000
small family

77
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.700
and set a is a particular company.

78
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.300
And it turns out that five people five family members

79
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.900
 of that.

80
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.600
Family work in the same company so the

81
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.400
 company and their family have these

82
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.700
 five elements in common.

83
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.300
what these quantities are is at the

84
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.200
 point the point is

85
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.300
How we use?

86
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.200
How we go from sets?

87
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.600
to

88
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.800
relative frequencies and from there

89
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.200
we can count or we can calculate conditional probabilities

90
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.000
 how we get marginal probabilities

91
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.900
 and Joint probabilities.

92
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.800
So I'm going to bring this.

93
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.200
diagram into our note

94
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.600
okay, so we have that diagram I

95
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.300
 talked about and then we have

96
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.300
we're going to put this data into a table.
