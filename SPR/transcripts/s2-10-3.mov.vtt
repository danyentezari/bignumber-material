00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.000
There's something called a quantile and that's how you divide.

1
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.100
the

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.800
data in your distribution in some regions

3
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.300
You would do this for example to to know how much variance you

4
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.900
 have the standard deviation of your probability

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.100
 distribution distribution, and there are a number of ways the the

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.300
 main three one of the following.

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.200
He can either divide them into four.

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.000
regions

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.900
That means we are using a quartile.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.300
Okay, a quartile is one type of quantile.

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.700
There's another one called.

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600
Decile, that's what you divide into 10 you can

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.300
 get away. Usually with having four four is more than enough, but

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.600
 if you have

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.600
like the first machine

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.000
That we looked at in our exercise where you have a lot of standard deviation. You

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.500
 may want to divide your distribution into more regions

18
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.300
 so you can start study them in more detail.

19
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.000
 Then you have one called percentile.

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.400
Which divides the distribution into 100

21
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.500
 regions?

22
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.900
by default

23
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.300
we will get the

24
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.500
the quartiles of the probability distribution

25
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.900
when you run the summary function

26
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.400
Okay, and this is telling you that the number 15.43

27
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.000
 is the start of

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.000
 the first quartile.

29
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.200
And then the median, is that

30
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.400
 the median for this now.

31
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.700
Column is 19 Point 20.

32
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.000
And the third quartile is 22.8.

33
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.500
And if you want the mean for example instead of

34
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.600
 just going to somewhere you can just type in mean.

35
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.100
And reference that same column.

36
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.200
to get the mean for

37
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400
your data

38
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.100
this should not be a function.

39
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.200
Okay, so you don't have to actually calculate this by hand.

40
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200
 It's right there.

41
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.200
Then you have variance or VAR for short same thing. You

42
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.400
 can just

43
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.900
throw in that

44
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.100
variable

45
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.100
Okay. So again empty cars refers to

46
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.800
 the entire document.

47
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.400
If you can if you're imagining a an Excel sheet.

48
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.200
And what comes after the dollar sign is

49
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.600
 corresponds to a column Within?

50
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.800
the document

51
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.700
okay.

52
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.300
So you want to know the variance?

53
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.500
Of that column again, you would use the four function

54
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.100
 pass in that column as an argument.

55
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.900
Enter and that's the variance.

56
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.900
Now, of course, we know that the variance.

57
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.300
Is what we use to get to the standard

58
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.400
 deviation. So for example, I can if you want to assign.

59
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.300
This variance to a variable you would say for example.

60
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.400
in

61
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.800
statistics we use Sigma squared to indicate

62
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.700
 standard deviation.

63
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.100
So I will hear I would put Sigma 2.

64
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.100
And I assign it to variable and if you see here now, we have

65
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.200
 a variable called Sigma 2 which corresponds to the variance if you want to know

66
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.300
 standard deviation.

67
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.100
You take the square root of the variance. So you

68
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.900
 would say Sigma.

69
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.000
Is the square root of Sigma?

70
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.900
squared

71
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.600
And that gives you the standard deviation.

72
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.200
There we go.

73
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.500
Of course, you don't have to do this. You can actually just go say SD.

74
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.300
And then pass in your reference.

75
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.700
That column to that day column.

76
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.800
And auto will give you the standard deviation just the same.

77
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.700
So these two numbers are equivalent.

78
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.300
Okay.

79
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200
So variance is what you need to get to standard deviation, but

80
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.300
 are still gives act it gives access

81
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.700
 to both.
