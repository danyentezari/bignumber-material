Let's go back to the reader and jump into the normal.

1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.800
distribution example

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.100
now how would you know whether you have to

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.200
 use this a cmf?

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.000
Or cumulative probably function or a PDF.

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.400
for continuous RVs

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.500
You have to look at the question.

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.700
This question is saying what that X?

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.800
It's experiments is within.

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.100
one standard deviation or you can rephrase this as

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.200
 between

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.800
like contained

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.500
You know between the first quantile.

13
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.100
within the mean

14
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.900
okay, so it's not one standard

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.500
 deviation away towards the left wants to

16
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.800
 standard deviation to the right. So these two quantiles.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.100
This is where the inequality comes in.

18
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.600
This is where these two inequalities come come in. Okay,

19
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.800
 so that's the

20
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.400
That's of course the probability function.

21
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.200
And we ask you that X.

22
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.000
is within

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.100
one standard deviation from

24
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.700
the mean

25
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.200
towards the left and one standard deviation from the

26
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.600
 mean towards the right.

27
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.000
By the way in the slides, there's a there's a look

28
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 table for all of these characters. What's what

29
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.800
 mu means what Sigma means what all of

30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.200
 these characters mean? You can always look them up.

31
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.100
mu refers to the population mean

32
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.900
Sigma refers to the population

33
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.600
standard deviation

34
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.800
Okay.

35
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.900
so

36
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.600
what we want to do.

37
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.500
when we plot

38
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.000
the

39
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.900
the values of the random variable it's experiments and

40
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.500
 it's probabilities on a plot like

41
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.800
 an x and y axis.

42
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.600
We have to shift it.

43
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.800
So that it's mean is zero again.

44
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.600
If you looked at the if you looked at the previous

45
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.500
 example with the what the

46
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.400
with the flash drives, for example, the mean wasn't

47
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.500
 zero it was we had random variables 1

48
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.100
 2 4 8 and 16

49
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.700
in order to use the normal distribution

50
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.900
so that we can

51
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.100
determine the probability

52
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.200
that

53
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.300
it's experiments fall within one standard deviation

54
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.500
 or two standard deviations. We have to shift the probability distribution

55
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.100
 to its Center.

56
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.600
In order to do that we use something called the standardization formula.

57
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.200
 There's a formula that gets your

58
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.400
 random variable to be standardized where it's mean

59
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.700
 shift to zero.

60
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.500
That is the z letter that you're looking at.

61
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.700
so by standardizing

62
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600
the random variable

63
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.400
by standardizing the random variable we are able to then set

64
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.900
 its standard deviation or rather.

65
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.200
You know actually determine whether it's whether it's

66
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.600
 experiments fall Within.

67
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.600
One standard deviation to the left one strategation to

68
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.800
 the right.

69
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.200
Okay, and then we have this.

70
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.800
this function

71
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.600
It's five function. It is called the now.

72
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.900
Phi is

73
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.600
It also a CDF. So also

74
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.600
 see the F but instead of P. We use this Greek letter

75
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.900
 of Phi and it is specifically for the standard

76
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.600
 normal distribution. So we have the normal probability.

77
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.200
 No the normal so this is

78
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.900
 your mouthful. We have the normal probability distribution, but when

79
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.700
 you standardize the normal distribution

80
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.700
He call it a standard normal distribution. That's when it's me has shifted

81
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.100
 to zero.

82
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.400
Then when you want to take the CDF.

83
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.700
Of the standardized normal distribution. You

84
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.000
 also have to use a standardized cumulative distribution

85
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.700
 function or standardized see the f

86
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.800
and that's what this Phi stands for.

87
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.100
So Z is

88
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.600
z is actually X after you

89
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.700
 have standardized it.

90
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.400
and Phi is p

91
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.700
for your standardized random variable

92
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.200
I I want to show you how we arrive at these numbers. This is

93
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.100
 where integration comes into play. I'm going to show you

94
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.800
 the formula for the standardized CDF.

95
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.500
 We'll go we'll switch to wall from alpha so

96
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.800
 we can calculate the formula.

97
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.100
so, you know what what this is actually

98
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.800
 doing to your

99
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.400
to these quantities

100
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.200
But once you have standardized your random variable.

101
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.300
once you've taken your ex

102
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.300
And you've normalized it.

103
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.600
To get Z now you can find.

104
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.900
the

105
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.600
the probability or the cumulative property

106
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.100
 probability

107
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.500
whether it's one standard deviation away from the mean or two standard deviations

108
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.300
 over if we want however many standard deviations. We want away

109
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.100
 from me, although you for a normal distribution. You don't

110
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.400
 want to go past three you go past three then

111
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.800
the thing that you're looking at is highly varied

112
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.400
 and

113
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.400
if it's if you're using it to influence your business decision,

114
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.700
 you would probably not want to go forward with that particular.

115
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.800
Sample space those that collection of experiments. So

116
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.200
 here we're looking at you can see that once we

117
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.200
 have our standardized random variable we

118
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.800
 can then.

119
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.300
Calculate for two standard deviations. That's what

120
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.200
 minus 2 here means and what positive 2 here means?
