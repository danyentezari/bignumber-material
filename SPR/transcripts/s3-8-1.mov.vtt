00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.500
Now, let's look at an example with multiple regression in

1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.100
 our studio.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.500
I have two examples here. Let me begin with the simpler one.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.200
So you become familiar with this intact and

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.500
 then I'll show you the more advanced one.

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.300
What we want to do.

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.000
Is plot a relationship?

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.700
between two

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.900
let's say data sets.

9
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.200
Okay, so we will create two vectors.

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.100
two vectors one-dimensional matrices

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.600
and then

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.900
use the

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.700
the modeling capability of our studio

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.400
 to see if

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.200
we can find some.

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.200
correlation covariance

17
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.900
between these two

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.900
Vectors so these vectors will effectively

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.400
 be our random variables.

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.600
Okay. So let's say we have two random variables one will

21
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.300
 be for height.

22
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.200
This is how you assign a value to a variable. This is

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.300
 your variable and this is the assignment.

24
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.600
syntax

25
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.200
And if you want to create a vector you say you type in

26
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 the C function and then you plug in your data points. So we have two.

27
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.800
Sets of data height and weight. We imagine

28
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.900
 these to be our random variables one random variable containing

29
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.000
 the heights of

30
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.800
people

31
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
and this particular example has to do with chess team.

32
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.300
So these are the Heights and weights of players on a chesty.

33
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.200
chess team

34
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.100
players

35
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.200
let's to plot these on a

36
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.900
 simple XY axis use the plot function from

37
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.300
our studio now that it takes on many different

38
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.800
 arguments.

39
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.200
What kind of plot colors?

40
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
The data points you want to plot but here's

41
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.200
 a simple example.

42
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.100
You begin as you can see here. It's indicating to me

43
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.000
 the arguments that you can pass to this function.

44
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.100
The first argument you pass will

45
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.000
 be what goes on to the x-axis?

46
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.400
The other one obviously what goes onto the y-axis so

47
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.900
 for X we will put a height.

48
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.200
and for why we will have

49
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.700
wait

50
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.900
Now, we also want to label our graph our XY graph.

51
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.800
To do that you have the third argument called xlab.

52
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.200
And you can type in whatever you want here. But this will be the

53
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.700
 height of students or Heights of the players in meters.

54
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.900
and for the y-axis

55
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.500
We will label it as well Waits.

56
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.900
and kilograms

57
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.600
now if you're from North America, and you're

58
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.500
 not familiar with these

59
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.900
units of measurement

60
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.400
I mean, this is the best unit of measurement. I don't know why they

61
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.900
 would use something like

62
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.100
what do you call? What do you have you have powers?

63
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.000
and

64
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.200
feet and inches

65
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.600
so much more accurate to use the empirical system. But

66
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.000
 anyway.

67
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.100
So we label our x-axis will label our

68
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.100
 white access. And if you just want to give your plot a name in general,

69
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.100
 there is the other argument called Main.

70
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.600
And we can say chess team.

71
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.800
Okay.

72
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.200
Now, let's see what we have after this point in our

73
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.400
 studio. There is no run.

74
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.500
You don't want to plus run because it runs the entire script. What

75
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.400
 we want to do rather is.

76
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.700
like

77
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.400
process these variables

78
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.200
plotted see what the product looks like and then

79
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.100
 continue with the remaining fast to do that. You click on the

80
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.100
 line that what you want to that you want to process. So we

81
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.400
 want to process line number two. So you click there and then

82
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.300
 you click on on Mac. It's

83
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.600
 command error. It's on Windows. I think it should be controlled enter.

84
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.600
 But if you do it correctly, you can see that now this

85
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.800
 variable has been stored in the environment.

86
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.600
Again, we will do the same for the weight.

87
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.300
So we now have these two vectors.

88
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.400
And the memory of the computer now we

89
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.500
 will use the plot function built into our studio.

90
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.800
to well plot these

91
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.600
okay.

92
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.500
And we can see here as the heights of the players increase

93
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.700
 so there's the weight.

94
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.200
It makes sense. You know, the bigger you are the more you will wait.

95
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.000
on average

96
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.600
so before I move on to the next line of code these

97
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.100
These circles remember from this side I showed these

98
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.900
 are the observed values.

99
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.800
Like these are actually people actually people.

100
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800
like this data point

101
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.200
that someone of who is 1.6 meters tall

102
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.700
 and

103
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.900
you know about

104
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.400
51 52 kilograms

105
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.600
That's one an actual person who was measured.

106
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.300
So is this one?

107
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.400
This person I think is about one seventy. I

108
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.400
 think it's 174.

109
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.000
That will be five foot eight.

110
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.900
five foot eight inches and 80 kilograms

111
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.300
which is about

112
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.500
I think 180 pounds.

113
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.800
So these are actual people now what we want to do is fit a

114
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.400
 line.

115
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.400
If the line fits properly like if it goes if

116
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.300
 it goes through this Center.

117
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.200
Or let me say if it goes like it.

118
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.600
if it

119
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.900
like it follows through because we could if you

120
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.100
 look at it carefully you kind of see a pattern right? Like there

121
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.200
 is a linear relationship between a person's height and

122
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.400
 their weight the totally you are the more you wait. Now, we know this of

123
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.400
 course it's common sense.

124
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.300
But visually if you look at it, you can

125
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.400
 kind of see there's a pattern though more you

126
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.700
 the taller you are the more you away.

127
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.400
What we wanted to do is get the the regression

128
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.200
 line to go through it.

129
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.300
So we can really make it obvious that there is in fact

130
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.000
 a linear relationship between the height of

131
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.900
 a person and the weight of a person.

132
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.900
So we've plotted.

133
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.300
The height of the weights of these people and we can see that there

134
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.600
 is in fact, there's a pattern emerging. Let's draw a

135
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.800
 line to draw a line through it.

136
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.800
There's a function called LM.

137
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.900
linear model

138
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.200
and if I if you open the first parenthesis, you will

139
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.700
 see the arguments that you can pass.

140
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.800
to the linear model the first argument

141
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.100
Is the formula?

142
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.700
Then you have their data points.

143
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.400
Substance of that data if you want.

144
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.100
But let's let's look at a simple example and it will

145
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.100
 explore the other arguments.

146
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.300
in a subsequent example

147
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.300
so we want to say

148
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.200
that

149
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.400
the weight

150
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.400
random variable

151
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.700
is a function of

152
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.600
the height random variable

153
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.700
now

154
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.100
quick note about this syntax this tilty.

155
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.300
 This till day doesn't have

156
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.800
 to do with normal distributions and tax. Okay, so

157
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.800
 wait here is the dependent

158
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.300
 variable.

159
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.500
Height is the independent variable for this particular model.

160
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.600
Okay.

161
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.700
If we had other coefficients.

162
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.000
or other

163
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.200
dependent variables you would append them with plus so you can

164
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.700
 have weight age. Let's say salary, whatever.

165
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:28.900
Okay.

166
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.700
So why this would be like your y equals and then?

167
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800
your regression model
