00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
So we've looked at the key terms and statistics and probability like the word

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.200
 the jargon you will revisit them.

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.100
But now let's look at the mathematical notation. The reason

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 we will begin with probability.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.500
rather than a statistics because

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.700
this is the prerequisite.

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.400
for learning the statistics notation

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.100
So either simple example suppose you have a

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.800
 pair of dice.

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.400
like two of them if you have two

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.200
dice we call them a die.

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.500
If you roll the die the same time meaning you

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.300
 take one dice another dice hold the Manifest in you.

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.400
roll them a simultaneously

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.100
you will get the following outcomes.

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.700
Remember the word outcome.

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.200
when you roll the dice recall that experiment

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.300
and when the

18
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.700
die land of the table we call that outcome.

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.100
So here are your outcomes this is your sample space.

20
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.700
You can either get two twos.

21
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.800
Or get one what we get a single one and two or you

22
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.700
 know, you can have one six another they

23
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.200
 want that's just one or you have one three one five

24
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.600
 and so on.

25
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.700
Okay.

26
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
So this is all of your outcome.

27
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.900
36 of them

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.000
the exercise requires us to do the following.

29
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.300
Use set notation.

30
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.100
You set notation to list all of the possible outcomes.

31
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.200
pay attention to that word in a set s

32
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.600
I did say that we can't avoid.

33
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.300
getting into other areas of mathematics, but

34
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.300
set theories actually quite simple.

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.800
Okay, so by the way, this will be good opportunity for you to know learn more

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.000
 than just probably in statistics.

37
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.700
But it requires us to you. I'm gonna I'm gonna show you

38
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.600
 the answer for this. I'm going to teach you how to do this. You said

39
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.000
 notation to list all the possible outcomes in a set as you set

40
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.100
 notation to list the event e

41
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.600
remember the slide

42
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.500
so the first one is s for the

43
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.600
all of the outcomes can get it says you set

44
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.100
 notation to list all the possible outcomes in a set

45
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.800
 s like the entire thing and then again, you said notation

46
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.500
 to list the event e would it die is rolled and the outcome add

47
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.800
 up to six.

48
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.100
So portion of the sample space.

49
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.200
And then it asks once you have these two things.

50
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400
What is the probability?

51
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.300
That number I told you about of event e in

52
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.100
 a sample six.

53
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.400
Okay.

54
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.100
Let's see how we can answer this question.
