00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.000
let's

1
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.200
collect

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.300
or let's assign to two variables the height

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.500
 of the male students and the height of

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.000
Females students so you have males here.

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.700
So this we will assign.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.500
You use a subset function?

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.200
what the subject function will do is

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.700
bringing all the data bringing all the columns.

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.300
That you have listed within a subset. So not the entire thing just

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.500
 specific columns.

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.400
So this would be students. I'll show you this right now students.

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.400
So you want the subset of the students data collection?

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.500
And you want to filter?

14
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.900
By let's say this criteria.

15
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.500
and this will give you

16
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.900
all of the rows all

17
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.900
 of the rows where the gender has male.

18
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.900
Okay, so you're filtering the data set. You

19
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.100
 won't find any other gender here. You won't find

20
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.300
 famous here. You can do the same thing with age height and so on. So for example, let's say

21
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.800
 you want to divide the students by their

22
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.600
a major

23
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.200
are in Humanities are they in stem and then you

24
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.800
 can visualize them with histograms?

25
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.300
And we can do the same for females.

26
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.000
Okay.

27
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.000
So now you have two.

28
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.400
subset of the main data collection

29
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.500
now, let's you and now let's plot them in histogram to see.

30
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.000
the distribution of heights

31
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.500
so the first histogram is for all of us students,

32
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.100
 but now let's clear this and look at

33
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.300
a plot with two of them plotted. So

34
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.800
 here we want.

35
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.800
the Heights

36
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.900
of the male students

37
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.300
and the heights of the female students.

38
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.900
and

39
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.600
we don't need to repeat ourselves.

40
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.100
With the scale, so this will be

41
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.800
 color one and we will use color too for this one.

42
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.100
So we don't get confused when they're overlapped.

43
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.700
And here we want to see add.

44
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.500
to indicate if you don't specify the

45
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.200
 ad then what's our studio

46
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.300
 will do is it will generate the first histogram and then discard the

47
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.900
 first

48
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.400
the preceding histogram to replace it with the other one, but we

49
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.000
 want to include both. Let's go ahead and run this function

50
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.500
 that gives us the height for the

51
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.100
 male students and the second one will overlap.

52
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.000
Indicating the height of the female student and you can see you know.

53
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.200
unsurprisingly

54
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.100
the females tend to be on the shorter side.
