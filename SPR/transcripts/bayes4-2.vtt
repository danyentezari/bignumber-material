Here's another perspective.

1
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.500
And it has to do with probability distributions.

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.400
Now remember a probability distribution is a function.

3
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.200
of its random variable

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.300
we talked about this in previous videos, right?

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.000
The random variable when you plot it.

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.300
Will produce a probability distribution a graph?

7
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.900
And graphs can be represented or expressed

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
 as functions so equations.

9
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.700
A probability distribution. Let me say this again a probability distribution.

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.400
Can be expressed in two ways

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.000
 as a mathematical equation.

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.700
or as a graph

13
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.700
so

14
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.700
we have probability distributions and we can

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.500
illustrate a probability distribution using

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.800
 it's equation.

17
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.900
My point here is

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.900
how

19
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.000
multiplication can combine

20
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.300
To probability distributions and merge them

21
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.600
 into one.

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.200
and

23
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.400
by multiplying two functions you produce

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.600
 a new

25
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.200
graph, that is the

26
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.300
well the product of two other graphs.

27
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.600
So suppose we have f of x in G of x.

28
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.700
f of x

29
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.300
is a function of x squared and

30
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.000
 G of X is a function of X cubed.

31
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.700
now if we multiply

32
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.300
x squared with X cubed

33
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.100
the power rule tells us that you would add up.

34
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.200
The powers so we would get 2 plus 3, which is 5 so this

35
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.500
 is what the function would look like.

36
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.700
the purple line

37
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.500
that is the same thing as well multiplying these

38
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.000
 two functions.

39
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.300
So fine remove these again.

40
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.300
The I function represented by the purple graph.

41
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.100
This is what happens if you were to.

42
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.700
multiply

43
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.900
x squared

44
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.800
and X cubed

45
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.000
and you get the same effect by multiplying the functions.

46
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.600
So you can see the green and the purple.

47
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.500
Are identical functions?

48
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.800
this is simple obviously, but

49
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.900
it is important to keep this in mind.

50
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.700
Especially when we look at examples where

51
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.100
 we have.

52
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500
What where we are going to deal with the Bayesian theorem?

53
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.800
but we have

54
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.800
a multiple events

55
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.300
multiple events that would give us

56
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.900
the posterior
