00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.300
I'm gonna take this equation top top most one this

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.500
 one.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.700
Bring it into box map and I will break down the terms for you.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.600
so

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.900
this is moment.

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.400
And this is the formula.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.500
so

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.300
if I break once we break this down, it will be so much

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.000
 easier for you to

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.600
make sense of the

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.300
of you know

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.000
the language

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.100
so

13
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.500
this all we've covered so far moment.

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.200
And here is that formula.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.900
Okay.

16
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.300
How many terms we have here? One, two, three one three we have three and

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.900
 then the third one has a couple of more.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.200
mu

19
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.900
Is what this is the population mean?

20
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.200
Remember that Greek letter talks about the population.

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.600
population mean

22
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.600
e of x

23
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.400
Is the expected value?

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.300
expected value

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.100
Okay.

26
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.900
e of x

27
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.600
Is the expected value?

28
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.200
But I told you that expected value is the

29
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.800
 same thing as the mean.

30
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.700
Mean expected value are the same idea. Why does then?

31
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.800
 Why do we have two different terms mean?

32
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.500
Is this is a general idea expected value applies

33
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.900
 to the random valuable specifically?

34
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.100
Like you ideally you wouldn't say the mean of the random variable you would

35
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.400
 see the expected value of the random variable.

36
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.900
So we have mu and E of x.

37
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.400
Make both me the same thing. Okay now mule can

38
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.800
 mean the

39
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.100
Population mean of the data set it can only be the population

40
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.300
 mean of the random variable. But if you were talking about the population mean of

41
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.200
 the random variable you would call it expect value. Sorry for

42
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.800
 the mouthful, but again terms are super important.

43
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.600
And then we have this guy.

44
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.400
the summation notation

45
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.600
summation notation

46
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.400
let me

47
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.000
copy this here this this portion of the

48
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.700
equation

49
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.400
put that in here.

50
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.200
And as if I think everyone knows what somebody's notation means

51
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.600
 it just means that you take this term.

52
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.000
And he added up.

53
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.400
Several times. So for example, we have

54
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.300
 the

55
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.200
X is the random variable bar X means the size of X. So for example,

56
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.500
 if you have five members in the random variable, then this summation notation

57
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.500
 would add this expression.

58
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.700
this expression five times

59
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.700
so if we take let's break down this summation notation

60
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.200
 some more e just the letter just the letter

61
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.400
 e

62
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.700
just a letter e or more specifically e to the power x corresponds to

63
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.600
 the macular and series.

64
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.900
McLaren series is a geometric series.

65
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.300
And it's it's one of its applications in is

66
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.700
 in approximating a number.

67
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.900
You can get a very close approximation the closest possible approximation.

68
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.800
Is achieved by Computing the McLaren series?

69
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.400
Now, why do we have t and X?

70
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.400
Okay, I want to avoid getting into tea.

71
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.800
because if I get into tea that's going to explode into

72
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.700
 a different discussion and that getting into eat

73
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.300
 the power T, which makes sense when we

74
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.000
 get into Workshop 2, but just know that e to the power x

75
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.700
that is equivalent to the macaron series, which I have typed out

76
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.800
 here.

77
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.800
Let's just say this is McLaren.

78
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.100
series

79
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.400
Okay, and P of X, you know what that is.

80
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.000
This is the probability for any given.

81
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.900
value in the random variable

82
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.200
So X.

83
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.400
sub, I

84
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.900
it's just the value within the random variable.

85
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.300
value

86
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.500
within the random variable. So for example, remember the the seat assignment.

87
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.300
the seats in the airplane

88
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.300
s122 whatever 5 would be one seat.

89
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.000
in all of the airplane

90
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.400
this would be

91
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.200
What do we call this?

92
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.600
value

93
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.000
in

94
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.300
random variable

95
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.800
and of course, we all should know by now that the random variable is

96
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.600
written with a big letter x

97
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.600
essentially what you're doing is this

98
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.600
you're at you you are.

99
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.600
taking

100
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.500
and approximation of a value

101
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.200
 of a random variable multiplying it with

102
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.300
 it's probability.

103
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.400
And you're doing this expression you're

104
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.900
 doing this.

105
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.200
You know mathematical expression.

106
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.100
as many

107
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.100
for as many times as there are values in the random

108
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.000
 variable. That's that's what summation notation means.

109
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.800
Okay, take the value in the random variable.

110
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.400
Multiply it by is probability. But let's just do the first moment

111
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.300
 and it will go the first moment. Like I told you this Mew means

112
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.000
 population me a population mean

113
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.100
and

114
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.200
if you want to compute the population mean that means you're calculating the

115
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.700
 first moment.

116
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.400
or you have X

117
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.100
and that just means that you take

118
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.000
in this for the first moment T will be equal to

119
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.300
 0.

120
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.100
As a matter of fact for discrete values

121
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.000
 T will always be equal to 0 so even you should not even

122
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.300
 see this.

123
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.800
T is only useful

124
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.800
for continuous random variables

125
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.800
so for example

126
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.100
This is what summation notation means for those who need to

127
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.900
 remember so much notation is so basically take this portion this expression.

128
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.100
Okay, and he added up.

129
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.700
For example, if random variable has five values you added

130
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.400
 up five times. So that's one.

131
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.800
and then two

132
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.500
and then you go on and not until you have five of these that's what

133
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.600
 this summation notation means.

134
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.000
So for example, if you want to calculate here, we have

135
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.000
 a probability distribution, right?

136
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.700
X is 0 1 2 3 so 4.

137
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.800
Items in the random variable so you would have to do this expression.

138
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.400
How many times four times?

139
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.500
For the first moment.

140
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.900
Okay.

141
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.900
for discrete random variables

142
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.300
T will always be to equal to zero

143
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.600
and I haven't typed out.

144
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.100
the the derivative of e of

145
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.200
 x

146
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.900
if you have a discrete random variable.

147
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.700
You will ultimately end up with this expression.

148
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.900
So for example that e

149
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.400
to the power, for example, what's the first x value

150
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.200
 it will be zero.

151
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.300
okay, so this would be this this x

152
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.800
 would be zero this x would be one this x would be

153
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.500
the last X would be

154
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.200
4

155
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.200
okay.

156
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.500
now when you take the derivative

157
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.300
of e to the power 0 remember because we're talking

158
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.000
 about discrete random variables e to the power 0 we would

159
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.000
 have e to the power 0 but then e to the power zero is

160
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.200
 just one.

161
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.700
E to the power is just one.

162
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.200
so

163
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.800
when we evaluate

164
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:12.900
this

165
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.300
expression

166
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.400
e of T disappears entirely and all we left with is

167
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.800
 x times the probability. That's what we have here. This

168
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.300
 is the first x times the first P of x.

169
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.300
This is the first this is the second

170
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.200
 x times the second P of x.

171
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.300
Third x third P of X and so on and then you get the probability.

172
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.500
Excuse me, you get the you get the mean?

173
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.800
You get the population mean?
