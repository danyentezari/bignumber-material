00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.600
The next term we want to talk about is the random variable.

1
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.900
First let's go back to experiments and

2
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.000
 outcomes. There are some experiments whose outcomes

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.100
 are not numeric.

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.300
Flipping a coin is such an example.

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.200
when you flip a coin

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.900
the result is heads or tails.

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.300
This type of data is not going

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.700
 to help us.

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.100
I mean the fact that it is heads and tails. So if

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.600
 we have a file or an X like

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.100
 an Excel sheet or a CSV file and we

12
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.900
 have heads and tails. We cannot perform statistical

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.100
 calculations on the word head.

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.100
Underwood heads on the wood tails

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.600
statistics is arithmetic.

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Right statistics if you

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.700
 want to calculate the mean average we need to work

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.100
 with numbers.

19
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800
So the word heads and the word Tails must

20
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.600
 be converted somehow to a number.

21
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.600
Because once we have a numeric representation, we

22
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.000
 can calculate mean median mode standard deviation

23
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.500
 Etc.

24
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600
We can learn.

25
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.900
things about our data

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.700
that's what a random variable does.

27
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.700
If you look here.

28
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.300
This is what we call a map.

29
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.900
in mathematics

30
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.500
a map

31
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.400
is

32
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.900
a general concept of a function

33
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.200
But this is what this notation means.

34
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.400
in

35
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.400
statistics and the probability Theory random variables

36
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.600
 are expressed usually with an uppercase

37
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.200
 that are X.

38
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.200
this colon

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.600
means that it takes you from one set of values to another set

40
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.200
 of values.

41
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.600
So we are defining a map X.

42
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.500
That takes you from one set of values. This is the Greek letter

43
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.400
 Omega Capital Omega.

44
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.200
And this is convention.

45
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.700
In many textbooks and

46
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
 papers literature you

47
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.500
 will see them use the uppercase letter.

48
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.400
Or the capital Omega to represent the sample space,

49
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.000
 right? So this

50
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.400
set of this set of sets.

51
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.900
Will be represented with the Greek letter Capital Omega.

52
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.300
So the X will map values from

53
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.400
 the sample space to values.

54
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.700
in the set of real numbers

55
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800
Why do we do this? Well?

56
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.400
suppose our sample set

57
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.100
We have two possible outcomes heads and

58
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.300
 tails.

59
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.400
What the random variable do?

60
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.900
Is it will convert for example h?

61
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.700
To the number one.

62
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.900
and T to number 0

63
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.000
so it will convert the data type so to speak.

64
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.200
Once we convert the data type from string to

65
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.300
 integer to use programming terminology, right?

66
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.600
If we have alphanumeric characters.

67
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.000
You can convert that to excuse me

68
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.500
 if you have.

69
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.400
Alpha or if you have letters and special

70
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.500
 characters, you can convert them to numbers to an

71
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.500
 integer or float. For example.

72
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.200
that's what a random variable is essentially doing it is converting

73
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.600
 non-numerical values to numerical values because once we

74
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600
 have these numerical values

75
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.800
we can perform arithmetic.

76
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.100
And compute their mean average.

77
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.400
And yeah, basically perform statistics on

78
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.100
 these quantities.

79
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.400
Let's say you perform for experiments.

80
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.700
with four outcomes

81
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.900
you flip a coin four times.

82
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.600
You get heads and then heads and then tails

83
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.100
 and then Tails see that's a set.

84
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.900
What do we call a set of outcomes?

85
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.700
event

86
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.200
So the letter A here represents this event.

87
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.200
And when we say that X is a map.

88
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.700
and here we are expressing it as a

89
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.000
with function notation

90
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.400
if we were to take a and plug it into X.

91
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.400
What we will do is we will map.

92
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.900
the values

93
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.600
that are not numerical to numerical values

94
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.200
 to real numbers.

95
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.900
And of course a is a subset.

96
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.600
Of the sample space, right?

97
00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.100
Up here we set that.

98
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.900
an event an event

99
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.300
Is a subset of the sample space?

100
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.200
so for example, this is a

101
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.000
and then we have B.

102
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.200
Okay.

103
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.100
Let's say there's a b but I haven't written it down. So we have two two events

104
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.600
 A and B.

105
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.000
A and B are both subset of

106
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.100
the sample space

107
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.200
Anyway, what the X random variable will do

108
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.300
 is it will map.

109
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.800
the values in the event

110
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.100
two values in

111
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.500
the real number elements in the real number

112
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.000
and from here we can perform.

113
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.700
arithmetic algebra so on

114
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.000
and then we have a probability function.
