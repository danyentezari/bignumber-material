00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.800
But let's continue talking about.

1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
Statistics of the high level now. How was statistics related

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.800
 to probability Theory?

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.400
How are these two disciplines related to each other? So we

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.300
 did say that statistics is a science of making inferences.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.700
And we said that inference can mean two things extracting relationships

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.300
 from data.

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.400
Or making forecasts Based on data, but we

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.500
 need to talk about where the data even comes from. Now. Let's

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.700
 talk about two key terms population at sample when we

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.400
 say population. We are referring to the entirety.

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.300
Of some things now these things could refer

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.100
 to a collection of people in a country

13
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.300
 for example the population of Canada.

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.900
Or it could be the entirety of an animal species all the assets held

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.200
 by a particular Holdings company.

16
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.700
Or even all the stars in our galaxy so population

17
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.000
 can be anything.

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.600
But it specifically refers to the entirety of those kinds of

19
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.700
 things.

20
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.100
Now for us to make inferences that is to say to

21
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.000
 extract your relationships.

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.200
Or make forecasts on this population.

23
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.600
Is to look at these numerical quantities we call parameters.

24
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.900
parameters include things like

25
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.300
mean

26
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.500
median and mode. Those are what we call measures of central tendency.

27
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.100
variance

28
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
the square root of which gives us standard deviation

29
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.100
 skewness

30
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.100
and other such numerical quantities, which as I said

31
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.200
 are referred to as parameters.

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.500
Now to find out what these parameters are.

33
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.200
So we can describe.

34
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.700
different qualities about the population

35
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.300
we depend on a subset of this population, which is

36
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.700
 called the sample.

37
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.200
In fact, we draw data from the

38
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.700
 population.

39
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
And this data that we draw from the population.

40
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.100
We use two further make inferences about the population. So

41
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.800
 this relationship goes two ways. Like it's

42
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.400
 super set the population the sample two

43
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.900
 has numerical quantities the same numerical quantities

44
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.700
 that the population has

45
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.500
mean median mode variance

46
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.500
standard deviation skewness

47
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.700
And all the others except when

48
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.100
 it comes to the sample, we no longer use the word parameters.

49
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.400
We use the words statistic and this is where the name

50
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.700
 of this subject comes from. So to

51
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.100
 make inferences about the population.

52
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800
And specifically it's parameters.

53
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.500
We use the statistics of the

54
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.900
 sample.

55
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.700
Now it's important for you to know.

56
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.500
that we are going to look at a number of

57
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.800
formulas at a mathematical expressions

58
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.700
and these mathematical formulas and expressions will come

59
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.700
 in different forms, depending on whether we

60
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.700
 are talking about the population or the

61
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.100
 sample because the mathematical Expressions will

62
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.600
 look different.
