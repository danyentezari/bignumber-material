0
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.600
the accompanying table gives the probability

1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.500
 distribution of the random variable y

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.400
where the amount of memory is put

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.900
 the amount of memory you find in a purchase Drive.

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.600
So what is this table mean? I'll show you to see the F now.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.000
you have

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.200
you're going to store.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.500
Or let's say you're looking at the purchase

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.400
 customers have made.

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.500
point five

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.600
this is the probability number.

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.400
between 0 and 1

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.600
.5. We can think about this as 5% but flash

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.100
 drives with one gig of memory one gigabyte of memory.

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.900
10% but

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.000
or the

16
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.500
I'm making mistake here. There is

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.800
 a 10% probability.

18
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.500
That the two GB flash drive

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.900
 would be sold.

20
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.800
There's a 35% probability.

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.500
That the flash drive with four GB.

22
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.400
storage moving stored and then

23
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.900
Percent probability that the flash drive with 8GB

24
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.000
 would be sold and then for the 16GB it there's

25
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.600
 a sharper decline.

26
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.800
I think today it would be like 256 would be the most.

27
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
128 256 GB

28
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.200
 flash shares or sold most and then when you

29
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.300
 get to like two terabyte 3 terabyte the big release massive storage

30
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.600
 ones.

31
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.700
They probably starts to decline because

32
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.900
most people wouldn't probably need that much storage.

33
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.300
But its same story is here not many if you

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.200
 look at this table just for a few seconds. It's I mean, we only

35
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.600
 have five items in the random variable you

36
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.000
 can see that

37
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.100
Very few people buy one GB like it's not

38
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.500
 enough whereas 16 is too much.

39
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.500
Okay again, let's imagine. This

40
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 is a long time ago.

41
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.600
So

42
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.600
here's how here's what the community commutative distribution

43
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.300
 function is about.

44
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.400
Determine F of Y.

45
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.700
the CDF

46
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.700
for each five possible values of Y. I'm going to open this up.

47
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.600
So whereas the PDF, excuse me, the pmf

48
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.400
 the previous example this one.

49
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.700
This one acts asks for a specific.

50
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.900
probability

51
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.500
or the probability for a specific value

52
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.000
the CDF asks for the probably of

53
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.900
a range of values like Elite up to

54
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.000
like less than or equal or greater than

55
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.500
 or equal.

56
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.700
Like what is the cumulative? Like? How does it probably accumulate?

57
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.000
as you progress down the

58
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.300
table of the random variable. Let's look at that. Let's look at

59
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.600
 the notation.

60
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.400
So you're saying that's just

61
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.700
 a function?

62
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.300
That's just that's a that's another name for the CDF.

63
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.400
Okay, let's focus on this part. If you're not familiar with function notation you're

64
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400
 saying

65
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.300
What is the probability I can uppercase p means? What is the probability?

66
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.100
 What is the probability that the random variable?

67
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.200
or what is the probability for the random variable when you

68
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.400
 have

69
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.600
flash drive storage 1GB or

70
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.700
 less

71
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.600
Well, we only have one gigabyte.

72
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.000
There's nothing less than one gigabyte.

73
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.700
So we asking

74
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.500
what is the probability that you would get one out of?

75
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.700
Or you would get this store this much space out of the other five spaces.

76
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.100
There are there's a typo here.

77
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.100
Yeah, so what is the so now

78
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.500
 what you're looking at first of all this table. This is the complete.

79
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.300
This is the random variable and one column. They probably distribution and

80
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.600
 the other column they're both together now.

81
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.700
This is what you would use to plot a graph.

82
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.400
Okay.

83
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.900
We only have one item.

84
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.100
So even though we're asking.

85
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.600
What what is the probability that you would have one GB

86
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.600
 or less? We only have one GB anyway.

87
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.300
So we just say y equals to 1 in other words. What is

88
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.100
 the probability that someone will buy a flash

89
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.300
 drive. That is one GB.

90
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.100
Well, we don't need to calculate the probability distribution that has

91
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.800
 been calculated before but it's 0.5.

92
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.000
That's given.

93
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.600
We're just looking at the notation for the CDF.

94
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.600
the next one asks

95
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.500
What is the probability?

96
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.100
That a y less than or equal to 2 that is to

97
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.600
 say what is the probability that the customer will buy one GB

98
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.000
 flash or 2GB Flash?

99
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.700
Well in order to evaluate this you add up the probability so

100
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.800
 you accumulate so you say 0.5 plus

101
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 0.10.

102
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.900
And that gives you 0.50.

103
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.400
So the probability that the customer will buy two GB

104
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.600
 or 1 GB is the probability of

105
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.600
buying one GB all of the plus the probability

106
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.600
 of buying two GP and they both add up to 15 right

107
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.600
 0.5 plus 0.10 15.

108
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.200
Let's look at one more. What is the probability that the customer will

109
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.500
 buy?

110
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.000
In some experiment the customer will buy 4GB flash

111
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.400
 2G. Oh rather 4GB

112
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.700
 Flash and below.

113
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.100
Well, we don't have 3gb. So we have we have 4GB. Those are

114
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.700
 the options we have 4GB.

115
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.200
You have 2GB and 1GB.

116
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.200
So what is the probability that they will buy 4GB 2GB 1GB?

117
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.400
Well, if you want to know the probability the cumulative probability

118
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.500
 add up the probability for all for

119
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.200
 these three outcomes.

120
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.300
So for four we get 0.35.

121
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.300
That's that's probably that a 4GB flash drive

122
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.100
 will be sold for two is 10 point 10

123
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.900
 point 10.

124
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.700
And then one is point five if you add this up.

125
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.500
You get point point five?

126
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.200
You can check this for yourself, but that's it has up

127
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.300
 to this.

128
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.900
So this is this is this is important Point here the probability

129
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.300
 that they would you know.

130
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.700
By up to or up to 4 is

131
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.700
 0.5. So it's increasing.

132
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.900
The thing is what the cmf and we will see this in later examples. It starts

133
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.400
 to Plateau. So here we can see it's trying to

134
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.100
 grow quickly. It went from point. It went from 5% to

135
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.600
 15% to 40 50%

136
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.000
But at one point it starts to plateau.

137
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.700
And we'll look at examples of that later. And that's where the CDF you know.

138
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.500
makes things more clear

139
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.900
makes things clearer

140
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.200
then of course we have what is the probability that they would

141
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.200
 buy eight and below and we can see

142
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.400
 it goes up to 90.

143
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.700
0.9.

144
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.500
Obviously if you enter the probability for all the

145
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:20.800
 values.

146
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.100
It works its way up to point nine.

147
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.700
And of course if you include the last random variable, it adds

148
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.400
 up to 1 so you're asking what is the probability that someone will

149
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.400
 buy 16 GB 8 GB 4GB 2GB 1GB.

150
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.600
 What is it? Probably any of them will be bought effectively. Well one

151
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.200
 100% one of them will be bought.

152
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.100
That's what the CDF allows you

153
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.900
 to understand.

154
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.000
You can start to see the probability increase.

155
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.200
With you know, as you make your

156
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.300
 way down the random variable, this is not always the case. It won't always look like look

157
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.900
 this way. Like I said in some cases it will start the plateau.

158
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.400
and if you're trying to

159
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.800
determine like how much should you spend for the probability

160
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.300
 of some or a set of events to increase?

161
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.700
And you start to see a plateau.

162
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.400
You may want to for example stop.

163
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.400
At a given value as opposed to continuing down the

164
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:22.600
 line.

165
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.700
Because the probability is not going to change the more you do it.

166
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.300
Okay, this is what we call.

167
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.700
What is the word I'm trying to use here or the phrase diminishing returns?

168
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.400
The CDF will help you recognize the diminishing

169
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:38.700
 returns.

170
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.700
But this is the notation again. This is about notation.

171
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:42.900
Okay.
