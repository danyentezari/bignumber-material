00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.600
So what do we have here?

1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.400
we have

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.300
x sub 1 is

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.800
normally distributed at 3

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.200
for the mean and 0.4. It's standard deviation

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.500
 and the other one 3.4 at the mean 0.2 and

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.100
 standard deviation. And now we want to know which one is better. The one that has a better

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.600
 mean or the one that has a better standard deviation.

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.600
Okay.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.100
Okay now.

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600
to standardize a random variable

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.400
you use

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.200
the random variable so you actually put it into a fraction.

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.400
 So

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000
That's so for example. You would take x sub 1.

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.300
subtract and then in the numerator use subtracted

16
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.500
 from the population mean

17
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.900
divided by

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.300
the standard deviation

19
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
okay this

20
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.900
has the effect of shifting

21
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.200
the random variable

22
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.500
the mean of the random variable two the center

23
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.000
and when you do that, we usually use the letter z

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.900
to indicate that you have now.

25
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.200
Standardize your normal variable.

26
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.100
That you've shifted its meaning you have shifted the whole

27
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.300
 thing.

28
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.600
to the left

29
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.000
and you will use Z sub 1 to indicate that this is

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.100
 the

31
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.500
standardized random variable for the first

32
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.900
machine

33
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.600
and then of course you would do the same thing for the second one.

34
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.700
So let's add another one.

35
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.600
And this would simply become.

36
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.100
Z2

37
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.200
for x sub 2

38
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.000
okay. Now we vote now we have

39
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.100
two

40
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.200
random variables that have been standardized

41
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.400
now we can use this in combination with

42
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.000
the given

43
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.300
the measurements

44
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.900
to determine finally which one is

45
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900
Which one's a better machine?
