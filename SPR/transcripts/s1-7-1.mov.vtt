00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.100
So now we have we know a little bit about probably like we

1
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.800
 know the fundamentals of probability.

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.300
This we have introduced ourselves to the this thing

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.300
 called probability this number that is between 0

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.300
 and 1 now. Let's introduce ourselves to the most important

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.600
 component in all of statistics and probability the random

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.900
 variable.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.600
Okay.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.100
This is where knowing those key terms is going to

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.400
 help us.

10
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.800
understand this concept of random variable

11
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.200
Okay, I'm gonna you will see the notation.

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.300
And then rotation will help you understand what this thing

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.300
 is.

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.700
first of all

15
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.700
the word variable

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.300
in random variable

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.200
is

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.600
Is a misnomer.

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.200
I don't know how many of you have experience with Statistics and probability but

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.500
Random variable is not really a variable in the mathematical

21
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.800
 sense. It's really a function.

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.100
I'll explain later on.

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.800
Okay, but

24
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.200
it's important for me to point out because

25
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.200
this variable is

26
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.100
written with an uppercase letter

27
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.300
What is in mathematics variables are

28
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.000
 written in lowercase letters?

29
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.200
and usually the letters at the end of the alphabet like X Y and

30
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.500
 Z let X be equals to five like why because the three but

31
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 there's a reason why the random variable

32
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Is a capital letter?

33
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.500
But anyway one at a time, let's consider

34
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.200
 an experiment. What's an experiment?

35
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.900
For being a coin rolling a dice.

36
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.700
That kind of thing.

37
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.500
Where seeds in a flight are aside customers automatically

38
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.800
 and randomly.

39
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400
so we have an algorithm in your on the

40
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.700
on the website

41
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.100
Here, for example, we have Emirates airlines in the

42
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.000
 UAE. You're on Emirates Airlines and you want to book a

43
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.500
business

44
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.700
business class flight to let's say,

45
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.800
 New York.

46
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.400
And let's say you're not particularly about your seating.

47
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.400
You don't care whether it's a what would be business class is

48
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.100
 not the best example, let's go with economy.

49
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.500
You can't choose between ilc or

50
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.200
 window seat and you don't care about that's a short

51
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 flight. And you say I don't really have time to worry about what I'm

52
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.400
 seated. Just give me a chair. So the algorithm will assign

53
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.800
 a seat for you.

54
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.300
Okay, we're getting closer to understanding what random battery was.

55
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.700
This is called I believe piecewise notation.

56
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.000
so t

57
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.400
this thing we call a variable will take on a value 0

58
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.800
 if this seat has already been assigned.

59
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.400
And one if the seat has not been assigned.

60
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.000
Okay.

61
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400
You see random variable is going to be.

62
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.500
a table

63
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.200
and there are two things that go into this table. This is very important for you to know

64
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.200
 from now from from the beginning the table will

65
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.400
 have two things values that a random variable can take

66
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.700
 and the probability of Any Given

67
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.800
 value.

68
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.300
So the random variable will take a value 0

69
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.200
 if the seat has been assigned which means you have to go to another

70
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.000
 seat and one if it's vacant.

71
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.500
Let's say you have a seat with this ID.

72
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.700
If it has been assigned.

73
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.400
And you try to look up that seat number

74
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.900
 in the random variable. This is the notation you will use.

75
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.500
And it's value will be zero.

76
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.100
Perhaps you can see why I'm saying why I said the random variable is

77
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.100
 not really a function. It's not really

78
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.300
 variable. It's more of a function.

79
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.800
The notation is giving away.

80
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.500
and of course if a seat

81
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.900
is available.

82
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.100
Like you pass in this number.

83
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.300
you get

84
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.000
one so if this if a seat

85
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.100
 with this ID is not available you get 0

86
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.200
If it is a if it's not available if it's vacant one

87
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.900
 and you keep on going for every other seat that you have.

88
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.400
And it will be 0 1 0 1 in the random variable.

89
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.600
Here's another word. I want you to be familiar with the word Bernoulli.

90
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.200
Remember I told you trials.

91
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.400
Which are special kind of experiments what the outcome

92
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.300
 is either one or two is called a Bernoulli.

93
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.500
Bernoulli well to Bernie Lee trial and

94
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.300
 if you have a random variable, well the outcomes can

95
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.500
 only be one or zero or success and failure or broken and

96
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.200
 not broken assigned another side what

97
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.400
 we have two can two possible outcomes. We call

98
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.900
 that a Bernoulli random variable.
