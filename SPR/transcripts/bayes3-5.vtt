Okay. So this one is the probability diversion because

1
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.200
this is probably because it's one event over.

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.800
the sum of two other events

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.200
Which are joint probabilities, of

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.800
 course, it's a joint probability. That's a joint probability a

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.100
 joint probability. What is this one?

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.600
is just going to be

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.800
the product of

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.500
a joint probability and a marginal probability

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.300
So when we plug in the these numbers

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.700
 we're going to have a numerator and a denominator.

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.200
So this will be one ratio comparing

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.300
 to

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.200
events. This will also be a ratio

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.100
 comparing two events.

15
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.100
So if I were to rewrite these expression if I

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.900
 were to re-read these terms a little bit we get we get this.

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.200
All right. So this is it.

18
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.400
What is the probability that they are guilty?

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.600
given a positive test

20
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.400
so they tested positive.

21
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.100
What is the probability that the actually are doping?

22
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.900
so if we plug in

23
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.400
The guilty hypothesis. That's what this

24
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.900
 H stands for. So hypothesis guilty.

25
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.600
So that's the a

26
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.300
and of course B is the fact

27
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.200
and of course B is

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.800
the positive test

29
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.700
To evaluate this. The first thing we will do is find out

30
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.800
 the odds of them being guilty and

31
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.700
 we do this this way.

32
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.900
We know that 19 out of those 1,000.

33
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.600
Athletes are guilty.

34
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.800
Right, so we know that 19.

35
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.400
Out of those 1,000 athletes are guilty.

36
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.500
And 931 are

37
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.400
 innocent.

38
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.300
If we evaluate this expression.

39
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
We will get this other term 1 over

40
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.700
 49.

41
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.200
So whatever 49 is the value of this odds.

42
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.000
Again, you can see it's a ratio.

43
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.000
Okay.

44
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.300
And how do we calculate the likelihood?

45
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.300
Now we know that the test has a 95% accuracy.

46
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.600
so the probability

47
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.100
that they would test positive.

48
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.800
Now let me actually put the subscripts here the positive

49
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.800
 test because these are positive tests.

50
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.300
Okay, so to evaluate the

51
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.800
 likelihood.

52
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.700
for

53
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.500
the equation up here

54
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.800
That's the that's why we want to find out right we know

55
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.300
 that the test.

56
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.200
Has a 95% accuracy.

57
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.100
for athletes who are actually doping

58
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.700
so naturally the probability that the

59
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.100
 athlete will test positive given they are guilty is 95%

60
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200
and 5% will hear innocent.

61
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.200
So we have two events.

62
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.400
Once again, we put these two events

63
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.700
 inside into a ratio.

64
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.400
That's likelihood.

65
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.700
And we get 19.

66
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.700
That is our likelihood.

67
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.700
Notice that this says that the odds

68
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.600
 are 19 times in favor of the numerator.

69
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.400
Your 19 times more likely.

70
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.800
to be

71
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.200
found guilty

72
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.100
by this test

73
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.000
but let's carry on now that we have our odds.

74
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.300
and our likelihood we're going to do some

75
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.500
 basic algebra to

76
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.000
get to our posterior likelihood.

77
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.200
And then once we have our posterior likelihood, we will

78
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.300
 turn that likelihood into a probability and get

79
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.900
 the final result.
