00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.300
So here's a data collection refer for I

1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.200
 guess the students at this German

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.500
 University.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.500
That's of course the link to their website.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.100
So we'll bring that in.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.700
And then here they're showing an example of how to use a histogram.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.000
so in to

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.900
Plot histogram. There's a

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.100
 built-in function in our city called hist.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.300
short for Instagram, of course

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.600
so it takes in a number of

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.200
arguments

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.900
so for example you have

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.700
the the x-axis

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.000
so if we look at the

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.600
head section or the the first number of

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.100
 rows of this.

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.700
data set

18
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.400
We have a few white in

19
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.600
 this a little more we can see more clearly.

20
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.800
we have

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.700
their student ID

22
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.200
their name their gender their age height weight and all of

23
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.400
 that stuff.

24
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.800
Okay.

25
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.500
Let's say you want to plot their height in a histogram. So

26
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.400
 you would say students.

27
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700
And then of course you want to read a particular column. Let's see for

28
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.500
 here. We want height.

29
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.400
Now how you visualize a

30
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.100
 histogram? They're different ways to visualize histogram now. I told

31
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.600
 you that there are.

32
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.400
Three ways to to produce a

33
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.800
 quantile.

34
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.100
There are quarters that's all percentile. But even even for

35
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.500
 the quartile there are different ways to calculate the

36
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.900
 quartile.

37
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.300
There are different algorithms. You can choose to choose the to critical quartile

38
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.500
 here if you want to break the histogram.

39
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.900
You can choose a different algorithm to use.

40
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.000
to create your histogram

41
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.600
So for this example, they're using the Sturgis method.

42
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.600
Okay, then.

43
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.000
You can also let's actually run

44
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.400
 this one.

45
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.300
Spelling mistake. Yeah.

46
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.400
spelling

47
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.100
mistake. Yeah, so this is a very basic.

48
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.000
basic histogram

49
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.900
Okay.

50
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.600
Now, of course if you want to like label the

51
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.900
 x

52
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.500
scale

53
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.100
you can add any more arguments. So for example, you can say x

54
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.400
 lab equals. For example, you can

55
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.000
 call whatever you want height of students.

56
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.100
And this would then generate another.

57
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.000
histogram plot

58
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.300
So now you can change its label.

59
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.000
Then of course.

60
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.200
You can I'm gonna put a light breaks to make this easier

61
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.500
 to read.

62
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.000
You can of course color.

63
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.600
You can color things you want. You can colorize you can color.

64
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.700
These Bars in the histogram. So for example would make

65
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.400
 with all of the graphs in R Studio. You have the color argument.

66
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.100
So you all for short?

67
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.200
Then we have different colors. They have one two three,

68
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.500
 so that's a good number three.

69
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.300
That turns the green. So if you want to for example visualize two

70
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.200
 histograms on the same plot, it

71
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.300
 can use different colors to see different

72
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.500
 things.
