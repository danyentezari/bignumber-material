4. **Example 1**: In a study testing the relationship between gender (male, female) and preference for a product (like, dislike), a Chi-Square Test of Independence is used to determine whether the variables are independent or if there is a significant association between gender and product preference.

5. **Example 2**: A company wants to see if the distribution of customer satisfaction levels (very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied) matches a hypothesized distribution. The Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test is applied to compare the observed satisfaction levels with the expected levels and determine if the deviation is significant.
