# Non-Parametric Tests

**Short definition**: Statistical tests not based on parameterized distributions.

**Long definition**: Non-parametric tests do not assume a specific distribution for the data, making them more flexible for various data types. They are used when data doesn't meet parametric test assumptions or when dealing with ordinal or nominal data.

**Example 1**: To compare the median income between two independent groups where income data is skewed, the Mann-Whitney U test is used instead of a parametric t-test, which assumes normal distribution of data.

**Example 2**: When evaluating the distribution of categorical responses in a survey (e.g., satisfaction ratings), the Chi-Square test assesses whether the observed frequency distribution differs significantly from an expected distribution without assuming any specific data distribution.
