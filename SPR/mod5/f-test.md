# F-Test

1. **Short definition**: Tests variance ratios between groups.

2. **Long definition**: The F-test assesses whether the variances between two populations or multiple groups are significantly different. It is commonly used in ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to compare group variances or in regression analysis to determine the overall significance of a model. The test statistic is calculated as:

$$F = \dfrac{\text{Variance between groups}}{\text{Variance within groups}}$$

A higher $F$ value indicates greater disparity between groups.

4. **Example 1**: In a one-way ANOVA, we compare the means of three groups. Suppose the calculated F-statistic is $F = 4.5$ and the critical value at a 5% significance level is $F_{crit} = 3.2$. Since $F > F_{crit}$, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding that at least one group mean differs significantly from the others.

5. **Example 2**: In a regression model, an F-test is used to assess the overall significance of the model. If the F-statistic is $F = 5.4$ with a p-value of 0.02, and the significance level is 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the model provides a better fit than no model at all.
