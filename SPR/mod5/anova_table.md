# ANOVA Table

This is an example of the ANOVA table.

| Source of Variation | Sum of Squares (SS) | Degrees of Freedom (df) | Mean Square (MS) | F-Statistic (F) | p-value |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| Between Groups       | $SS_B$                | $k - 1$                   | $MS_B = SS_B / (k - 1)$ | $F = MS_B / MS_W$ | $p$      |
| Within Groups        | $SS_W$                | $N - k$                   | $MS_W = SS_W / (N - k)$  |                 |         |
| Total                | $SS_T$                | $N - 1$                   |                  |                 |         |


In ANOVA, the following measurements are essential, each with its specific purpose and expectations:

1. **Between-group variance (Mean Square Between, MSB)**:
   - **Purpose**: Measures the variance between the group means.
   - **Expectation**: If the group means are significantly different, the MSB will be large. If no significant difference exists, it will be similar to the within-group variance.
  
2. **Within-group variance (Mean Square Within, MSW)**:
   - **Purpose**: Measures the variability within each group, assessing how much individual observations deviate from their group mean.
   - **Expectation**: A relatively small MSW indicates less variability within groups, while a large MSW shows high variability.

3. **F-ratio (F-statistic)**:
   - **Purpose**: Compares the MSB to MSW to determine if the group means are significantly different.
   - **Expectation**: A large F-ratio suggests significant differences between the group means, while a small F-ratio indicates no significant differences.

4. **p-value**:
   - **Purpose**: Assesses the statistical significance of the F-ratio.
   - **Expectation**: A p-value less than a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05) indicates that the differences between group means are statistically significant.

5. **Degrees of freedom (df)**:
   - **Purpose**: Used to calculate MSB, MSW, and the F-ratio, reflecting the number of independent comparisons being made.
   - **Expectation**: The degrees of freedom for between-group variance is based on the number of groups, while for within-group variance, it's based on the total number of observations minus the number of groups.

Each of these measurements is critical for determining whether the differences observed between groups are due to random chance or actual differences in population means.
