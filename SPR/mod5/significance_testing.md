# Significance Testing

1. **Short definition**: Assessing evidence against a null hypothesis.

2. **Long definition**: Significance testing determines whether a sample provides enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis. It involves calculating a test statistic, comparing it to a critical value or p-value, and concluding whether to reject the null hypothesis. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates that the observed data are unlikely under the null hypothesis. Significance testing helps evaluate claims in scientific research.

6. **Example 1**: Suppose a drug company claims that a new treatment increases recovery rates. A researcher conducts a significance test with a null hypothesis $H_0$: the treatment has no effect. The researcher collects data and calculates a p-value of 0.03. Since 0.03 is less than the 0.05 significance level, they reject $H_0$, concluding the treatment likely increases recovery rates.

7. **Example 2**: In a study, researchers test whether a coin is fair. The null hypothesis $H_0$ states that the coin has an equal probability of landing heads or tails. After flipping the coin 100 times and getting 60 heads, they perform a significance test. With a p-value of 0.06, which is higher than the 0.05 significance level, they fail to reject $H_0$, concluding there's no strong evidence that the coin is biased.
