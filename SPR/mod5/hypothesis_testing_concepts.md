# Hypothesis Testing

1. **Short definition**: Statistical method for testing claims or assumptions.

2. **Long definition**: Hypothesis testing is a statistical process used to decide whether a given claim (hypothesis) about a population parameter is likely true based on sample data. It involves comparing a null hypothesis $ H_0 $ against an alternative hypothesis $ H_1 $, using a test statistic and a significance level $ \alpha $.

4. **Example 1**: In a clinical trial, a researcher wants to test whether a new drug has a higher success rate than the current standard. The null hypothesis $ H_0 $ is that the success rate of the new drug is the same as the current one, while the alternative hypothesis $ H_1 $ suggests the new drug is more effective. Data is collected, and a z-test is conducted. Based on the test statistic and the significance level (e.g., $ \alpha = 0.05 $), the researcher either rejects or fails to reject the null hypothesis, determining whether the drug is statistically more effective.

5. **Example 2**: A factory claims that the average weight of its products is 500 grams. A quality control team samples 50 items and finds a sample mean of 495 grams. The team conducts a t-test to determine whether this deviation is statistically significant. The null hypothesis $ H_0 $ assumes the mean weight is 500 grams, and the alternative hypothesis $ H_1 $ posits a different mean. Using a 5% significance level and calculating the test statistic, the team evaluates whether the deviation warrants rejecting the claim or if it could occur by random chance.
