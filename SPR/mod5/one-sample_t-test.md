4. **Example 1**: A nutritionist wants to determine if a new diet impacts the average daily calorie intake of a population. They collect a sample and perform a one-sample t-test to compare the sample mean intake to the recommended 2000 calories per day, testing if the populationâ€™s mean intake differs from this value.

5. **Example 2**: In a manufacturing process, a quality control manager checks if the average weight of produced items is consistent with the target weight of 500 grams. A sample is taken, and a one-sample t-test is used to test if the average weight significantly deviates from the 500 grams target.
